This paper specifically compares pie menus with linear menus. Although other researchers have investigated similar themes it is felt that there is still not enough knowledge regarding the various effects of different menu types, including their positioning on a screen. An empirical approach using an experiment to test the effectiveness and user satisfaction of a pie menu and a linear menu is described in detail. Four tasks were administered to experimental participants under each menu design in a within users experimental design. Overall task time, number of errors and participants' subjective opinions were measured. The data were statistically analysed. There were no statistically significant results for task times and errors. However, subjective opinions were overall statistically significant, suggesting a preference for the pie menu by participants. These results are interesting for all web designers, user interface designers and developers. The issues being investigated are rather complex, because there is no clear pattern of results to suggest a categorical \u2018best design\u2019. These results add to the current knowledge in existence regarding menu types and to the wish of understanding better the issues involved with menu types.

The overall aim of the experiment (one of a suite of experiments) is to determine the effectiveness and user approval of mapping human-oriented information to software agents. The preliminary results presented in this paper involve user approval issues. This subject area, involving anthropomorphism at the user interface as part of a feedback agent(s), is currently surrounded with controversy. The Computer Science community is divided on this issue, where they are either for (e.g. (Agarwal 1999; Cole, Massaro et al. 1999; Dertouzos 1999; Guttag 1999; Zue 1999)) or against, (e.g. Shneiderman in (Shneiderman 1992; Bradshaw 1997)) anthropomorphism at the user interface. However, they do not provide concrete enough evidence for their stance. The experiment described in this paper aims to begin to resolve this issue, particularly with respect to effectiveness and user approval. The experiment (involving UNIX commands) falls within one broad area or 'strand' of software. This is software for online systems usage. If interesting and meaningful results can be obtained, these will potentially affect future user interfaces. This will have implications for software in different domains, including software that could be defined as 'non-standard' such as the software sometimes used in command centres and control rooms. These could lead to new types of more usable interfaces. This would be particularly so with respect to training novices to use 'non-standard' user interfaces, or where a command centre or control room in an organisation is migrating to a virtual control room and staff require an update to their training.
