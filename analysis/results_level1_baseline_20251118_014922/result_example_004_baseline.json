There is a suspicion that this question has an answer in error. Re-watched the video manually, re-read Wikipedia. Penguins are one species of bird. Seagulls are another species of bird. Bottom line: 2 species can be in the chamber at the same time. Can you tell me at what timestamp the 3 species of birds occur? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM petrov826 Jul 31 \u2022 edited Aug 10 Same here. All I could find was one petrel, a herd of baby penguins, and one mother(or father) penguin. So the answer might be 2 not 3.
