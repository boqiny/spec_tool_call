This paper specifically compares pie menus with linear menus. Although other researchers have investigated similar themes it is felt that there is still not enough knowledge regarding the various effects of different menu types, including their positioning on a screen. An empirical approach using an experiment to test the effectiveness and user satisfaction of a pie menu and a linear menu is described in detail. Four tasks were administered to experimental participants under each menu design in a within users experimental design. Overall task time, number of errors and participants' subjective opinions were measured. The data were statistically analysed. There were no statistically significant results for task times and errors. However, subjective opinions were overall statistically significant, suggesting a preference for the pie menu by participants. These results are interesting for all web designers, user interface designers and developers. The issues being investigated are rather complex, because there is no clear pattern of results to suggest a categorical \u2018best design\u2019. These results add to the current knowledge in existence regarding menu types and to the wish of understanding better the issues involved with menu types.

Khan 1 Department of Computer Science, the Universal Design of ICT Research Group, Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences, Oslo, Norway 2 University of Salford, School of Computing, Science and Engineering, Salford, M5 4WT, UK 1 pietro.murano@hioa.no, 2I.N.Khan@edu.salford.ac.uk ABSTRACT This paper is about a continuing investigation aiming to find out which menu type is more useable on a web site or application. This paper specifically compares pie menus with linear menus. Although other researchers have investigated similar themes it is felt that there is still not enough knowledge regarding the various effects of different menu types, including their positioning on a screen. An empirical approach using an experiment to test the effectiveness and user satisfaction of a pie menu and a linear menu is described in detail. Four tasks were administered to experimental participants under each menu design in a within users experimental design. Overall task time, number of errors and participants' subjective opinions were measured. The data were statistically analysed. There were no statistically significant results for task times and errors. However, subjective opinions were overall statistically significant, suggesting a preference for the pie menu by participants. These results are interesting for all web designers, user interface designers and developers. The issues being investigated are rather complex, because there is no clear pattern of results to suggest a categorical \u2018best design\u2019. These results add to the current knowledge in existence regarding menu types and to the wish of understanding better the issues involved with menu types.
