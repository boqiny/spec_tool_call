Basically, just working with numbers.\n\nThis SHOULD be a level familiar with you. If you are not familiar with arithmetic math/rules, then PLEASE review through Arithmetic, as you won't survive even the 1st step of Algebra. Trust me, the basics are THAT important.\n\n## Fractions [ edit | edit source ]\n\n![A Cake with fractions]\n\nFractions (from Latin fractus, \"broken\") are parts of a whole. In the image of a cake, there is only 3/4's of the cake showing, the other 1/4 has been eaten/taken away.\n\nThe number, 3, in 3/4, is what is known as a numerator (Numerator: Number at the top, tells us of how much of the number is being talked about/being used). The number, 4, in 3/4, is what is known as a denominator (Denominator: Number showing the all time total).\n\n### Simplest form/reduced form\n\nA reduced form of a fraction is a fraction that cannot be divided by any number other than 1, and the denominator is greater than 1. So 2/4 is NOT in simplest form, since we can divide 2 and 4, by 2... which results in the following number: 1/2. Though, not every fraction can be divided by 2, there are fractions, such as: 5/35, 7/21, and 30/5. The two first fractions are not divisible by 2, and 30/5 can not be divided by 2 on both sides, but only on 30. It's important to simplify as if you were in a test, your teacher will mark your problems as incorrect if you didn't simplify your fractions. It's also important to note that a simplified fraction and the non-simplified fraction (that, if simplified, equals that fraction) are the same, and represent the same quantity. So, 2/4 and 1/2 represents the same quantity, a half!\n\nHere, we will present a few fractions for you to simplify.\n\n**Sample problems for simplifying fractions (use / as the fraction line) [ edit | edit source ]**\n\n1. 6/8 = [    ]  \n2. 4/60 = [    ]  \n3. 30/90 = [    ]  \n4. 8/18 = [    ]  \n5. 9/72 = [    ]  \n6. 64/46 = [    ]  \n7. 206/340 = [    ]\n\n[ Submit ]\n\n![4 x 3 = 12 (multiplication)]"
