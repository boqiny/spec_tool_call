Despite the ominous (some might say fatalistic) name, the book is actually a celebration of the best dishes that are unique to this country. The Sterns, who have been focusing on quirky All-American food haunts since 1977, describe in delicious detail, the best dishes proffered at roadside stands, cafes, street carts throughout the fruited plain. Farolitos Festoon the Path to the Bar In an interview with the Wall Street Journal , Michael Stern was asked if the inclusion of the words \u201c too late \u201d in the book\u2019s title referred to the \u201c death of the small eatery, or the reader\u2019s impending doom from eating too much fried chicken, French fries and fried fish .\u201d He indicated he was referring to \u201c the impending onslaught of the nutrition police who will make all of this stuff illegal one of these days .\u201d He also warned of the loss of \u201csome variety and some local specialties that were once easy to find and are now hard or impossible to find due to chain restaurants.\u201d One of Papa Felipe\u2019s Dining Rooms Despite the onslaught of the ubiquitous national food chain, Stern was optimistic that \u201cAmericans have become m\n\n2.

Despite the ominous (some might say fatalistic) name, the book is actually a celebration of the best dishes that are unique to this country. The Sterns, who have been focusing on quirky All-American food haunts since 1977, describe in delicious detail, the best dishes proffered at roadside stands, cafes, street carts throughout the fruited plain. Farolitos Festoon the Path to the Bar In an interview with the Wall Street Journal , Michael Stern was asked if the inclusion of the words \u201c too late \u201d in the book\u2019s title referred to the \u201c death of the small eatery, or the reader\u2019s impending doom from eating too much fried chicken, French fries and fried fish .\u201d He indicated he was referring to \u201c the impending onslaught of the nutrition police who will make all of this stuff illegal one of these days .\u201d He also warned of the loss of \u201csome variety and some local specialties that were once easy to find and are now hard or impossible to find due to chain restaurants.\u201d One of Papa Felipe\u2019s Dining Rooms Despite the onslaught of the ubiquitous national food chain, Stern was optimistic that \u201cAmericans have become m\n\n2.

Tis the season\u2026for year-end retrospectives in which the good, the bad and the ugly; the triumphs and tragedies; the highs and lows and the ups and downs are revisited ad-infinitum by seemingly every print and cyberspace medium in existence. It\u2019s the time of year in which the \u201cin-your-face\u201d media practically forces a reminiscence\u2013either fondly or with disgust\u2013about the year that was. It\u2019s a time for introspection, resolutions and for looking forward with hope to the year to come. The New Mexico culinary landscape had more highs than it did lows in 2015. Here\u2019s my thrilling (and filling) recap. Hardly a week passed during 2016 in which the world didn\u2019t lose one or more of the biggest names in music, acting, literature and politics. We celebrate their lives and mourn their passing. While perhaps not as tragic, 2016 also saw the closure of several beloved restaurants. Some flashed early potential only to fade quickly.
