It blew out a huge bi-lobed bubble that blasted through the interstellar medium in two directions. Whatever it was, it released huge amounts of energy from the central supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A* for short). These bubbles contain weird, spindly one-dimensional vertical filaments that emit radio signals of their own. In 1984, astronomer Farhad Yusef-Zadeh at Northwestern University and his collaborators were the first to observe these wispy trails . Now, they know of more than a thousand of them. They give off radio waves in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Wait, There's More! Recently, the team found a smaller population of filaments near Sgr A*. However, these aren't vertical. Instead, they lie along the galactic plane and radiate away like spokes on a wheel. \"It was a surprise to suddenly find a new population of structures that seem to be pointing in the direction of the black hole,\" Yusef-Zadeh said. \"We have always been thinking about vertical filaments and their origin. I'm used to them being vertical. I never considered there might be others along the plane.\" He and the team were stunned when they saw these radially stretched structures. \"We had to do a lot of work to establish that we weren't fooling ourselves,\" he said. \"And we found that these filaments are not random but appear to be tied to the outflow of our black hole.

In a recent study of dim, distant objects, astronomers at the University of Missouri found at least 300 of them that look way too bright. That means they're forming stars much earlier than expected, or something else is going on. Whatever it is could affect our understanding of events in the infant cosmos. Moonquakes Will Pose Risks To Long-term Lunar Base Structures August 14, 2025 Our Moon is a seismically active world and its long history of quakes could affect the safety of permanent base structures there.

This bustling downtown of the Milky Way is a potential treasure trove of discovery but has been difficult to study as the galaxy's central regions are obscured by dust and glaring radiation. But a new image of this region with unprecedented detail reveals more than we've ever seen before. We find some familiar objects like supernovae but also some mysterious structures \u00e2\u0080\u0093 gaseous filaments dozens of light years long channeling electrons at near light speed. Behold, the galaxy's centre as never seen before: Creating this incredible image required the power of the MeerKAT observatory . MeerKAT is located in South Africa which has a vantage point of the galaxy's centre 25,000 light years away toward the constellation Sagittarius. MeerKAT sees the Universe in radio waves which penetrate interstellar dust normally obscuring this region of space. The image above is the result of 144 hours of telescope observation and 70 terabytes of raw data. Created from 20 separate pointings, the image is a mosaic representing 6 square degrees of sky - the equivalent of *30 full Moons* spanning 4 full Moons wide - not just a speck in the night. If your eyes were sensitive enough to radio waves, this is what the the galaxy would look like above you.

This is due in part to the fact that our Solar System is embedded within the disk of the Milky Way - the flattened region that extends outwards from the core. This has made seeing into the bulge at the center of our galaxy rather difficult. Nevertheless, what we've been able to learn over the years has proven to be immensely interesting. For instance, in the 1970s, astronomers became aware of the Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) at the center of our galaxy, known as Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). In 2016, astronomers also noticed a curved filament that appeared to be extending from Sgr A*. Using a pioneering technique, a team of astronomers from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) recently produced the highest-quality images of this structure to date. The study which details their findings, titled \" A Nonthermal Radio Filament Connected to the Galactic Black Hole? \", recently appeared in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. In it, the team describes how they used the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's (NRAO) Very Large Array to investigate the non-thermal radio filament (NTF) near Sagittarius A* - now known as the Sgr A West Filament (SgrAWF).

It blew out a huge bi-lobed bubble that blasted through the interstellar medium in two directions. Whatever it was, it released huge amounts of energy from the central supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A* for short). These bubbles contain weird, spindly one-dimensional vertical filaments that emit radio signals of their own.

Ragan , Thomas Henning , Jochen Tackenberg , Henrik Beuther , Katharine G. Johnston , Jouni Kainulainen , Hendrik Linz View a PDF of the paper titled Giant Molecular Filaments in the Milky Way, by Sarah E. Ragan and 6 other authors View PDF Abstract: Throughout the Milky Way, molecular clouds typically appear filamentary, and mounting evidence indicates that this morphology plays an important role in star formation. What is not known is to what extent the dense filaments most closely associated with star formation are connected to the surrounding diffuse clouds up to arbitrarily large scales. How are these cradles of star formation linked to the Milky Way's spiral structure? Using archival Galactic plane survey data, we have used multiple datasets in search of large-scale, velocity-coherent filaments in the Galactic plane. In this paper, we present our methods employed to identify coherent filamentary structures first in extinction and confirmed using Galactic Ring Survey data. We present a sample of seven Giant Molecular Filaments (GMFs) that have lengths of order $\\sim$100 pc, total masses of 10$^4$ - 10$^5$ M$_{\\odot}$, and exhibit velocity coherence over their full length. The GMFs we study appear to be inter-arm clouds and may be the Milky Way analogues to spurs obser\n\n3.

That's because there's a lot going on there. Not only is there a supermassive black hole, but also populations of very ancient red giant stars that swarm the center. Most of them date back at least to the formation of the Galaxy. Astronomers used the Canada-France-Hawai'i telescope in Hawaii to study a selection of these stars. They wanted to understand their characteristics and longevity. The observations are part of the \"Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey (PIGS) project. It's been studying the core of the Milky Way for several years now to understand these ancient stars. PIGs Ancient Stars in the Core Other studies have shown that stars began their formation in what's now the core of the Milky Way. The PIGs stars are the remaining members of the \"inner court\" of the Milky Way. They spin slowly around the core and spend most of their lives there. Chemically, they're very different from the younger stars scattered throughout the Galaxy. The oldsters are mostly hydrogen and helium, which indicates they formed at a very early epoch of cosmic history.  By comparison, the younger stars in the Milky Way have higher abundances of \"metals\" such as carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and so on. There are many stars in the Universe itself that formed shortly after the Big Bang from the largely hydrogen- and helium-rich environment. Astronomers can use them as \"templates\" to study stars in our own Milky Way to determine what it was like in its infancy. Typically, such old stars exist in the core region of the Galaxy, and in the swarm of stars that make up a low-density halo around the Milky Way. According to PIGS team memb\n"

G. ; Wardle, M. ; Heywood, I. Abstract We have examined the distribution of the position angle (PA) of the Galactic center filaments with lengths L > 66\u2033 and <66\u2033 as well as their length distribution as a function of PA. We find bimodal PA distributions of the filaments, and long and short populations of radio filaments. Our PA study shows the evidence for a distinct population of short filaments with PA close to the Galactic plane. Mainly thermal, short-radio filaments (<66\u2033) have PAs concentrated close to the Galactic plane within 60\u00b0 < PA < 120\u00b0. Remarkably, the short filament PAs are radial with respect to the Galactic center at l < 0\u00b0 and extend in the direction toward Sgr A*. On a smaller scale, the prominent Sgr E H II complex G358.7-0.0 provides a vivid example of the nearly radial distribution of short filaments. The bimodal PA distribution suggests a different origin for two distinct filament populations. We argue that the alignment of the short-filament population results from the ram pressure of a degree-scale outflow from Sgr A* that exceeds the internal filament pressure, and aligns them along the Galactic plane. The ram pressure is estimated to be 2 \u00d7 10 6 cm -3 K at a distance of 300 pc, requiring biconical mass outflow rate 10 -4 M \u2299 yr -1 with an opening angle of ~40\u00b0. This outflow aligns not only the magnetized filaments along the Galactic plane but also accelerates thermal material associated with embedded or partially embedded clouds. This places an \n\n3.

It blew out a huge bi-lobed bubble that blasted through the interstellar medium in two directions. Whatever it was, it released huge amounts of energy from the central supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A* for short). These bubbles contain weird, spindly one-dimensional vertical filaments that emit radio signals of their own. In 1984, astronomer Farhad Yusef-Zadeh at Northwestern University and his collaborators were the first to observe these wispy trails . Now, they know of more than a thousand of them. They give off radio waves in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Wait, There's More! Recently, the team found a smaller population of filaments near Sgr A*. However, these aren't vertical. Instead, they lie along the galactic plane and radiate away like spokes on a wheel. \"It was a surprise to suddenly find a new population of structures that seem to be pointing in the direction of the black hole,\" Yusef-Zadeh said. \"We have always been thinking about vertical filaments and their origin. I'm used to them being vertical. I never considered there might be others along the plane.\" He and the team were stunned when they saw these radially stretched structures. \"We had to do a lot of work to establish that we weren't fooling ourselves,\" he said. \"And we found that these filaments are not random but appear to be tied to the outflow of our black hole. By studying them, we could learn more about the black hole's spin and accretion disk orientation.

In a recent study of dim, distant objects, astronomers at the University of Missouri found at least 300 of them that look way too bright. That means they're forming stars much earlier than expected, or something else is going on. Whatever it is could affect our understanding of events in the infant cosmos.

This bustling downtown of the Milky Way is a potential treasure trove of discovery but has been difficult to study as the galaxy's central regions are obscured by dust and glaring radiation. But a new image of this region with unprecedented detail reveals more than we've ever seen before. We find some familiar objects like supernovae but also some mysterious structures \u00e2\u0080\u0093 gaseous filaments dozens of light years long channeling electrons at near light speed. Behold, the galaxy's centre as never seen before: Creating this incredible image required the power of the MeerKAT observatory . MeerKAT is located in South Africa which has a vantage point of the galaxy's centre 25,000 light years away toward the constellation Sagittarius. MeerKAT sees the Universe in radio waves which penetrate interstellar dust normally obscuring this region of space. The image above is the result of 144 hours of telescope observation and 70 terabytes of raw data. Created from 20 separate pointings, the image is a mosaic representing 6 square degrees of sky - the equivalent of *30 full Moons* spanning 4 full Moons wide - not just a speck in the night. If your eyes were sensitive enough to radio waves, this is what the the galaxy would look like above you.

This is due in part to the fact that our Solar System is embedded within the disk of the Milky Way - the flattened region that extends outwards from the core. This has made seeing into the bulge at the center of our galaxy rather difficult. Nevertheless, what we've been able to learn over the years has proven to be immensely interesting. For instance, in the 1970s, astronomers became aware of the Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) at the center of our galaxy, known as Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). In 2016, astronomers also noticed a curved filament that appeared to be extending from Sgr A*. Using a pioneering technique, a team of astronomers from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) recently produced the highest-quality images of this structure to date. The study which details their findings, titled \" A Nonthermal Radio Filament Connected to the Galactic Black Hole? \", recently appeared in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. In it, the team describes how they used the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's (NRAO) Very Large Array to investigate the non-thermal radio filament (NTF) near Sagittarius A* - now known as the Sgr A West Filament (SgrAWF).

Ragan and 6 other authors View PDF Abstract: Throughout the Milky Way, molecular clouds typically appear filamentary, and mounting evidence indicates that this morphology plays an important role in star formation. What is not known is to what extent the dense filaments most closely associated with star formation are connected to the surrounding diffuse clouds up to arbitrarily large scales. How are these cradles of star formation linked to the Milky Way's spiral structure? Using archival Galactic plane survey data, we have used multiple datasets in search of large-scale, velocity-coherent filaments in the Galactic plane. In this paper, we present our methods employed to identify coherent filamentary structures first in extinction and confirmed using Galactic Ring Survey data. We present a sample of seven Giant Molecular Filaments (GMFs) that have lengths of order $\\sim$100 pc, total masses of 10$^4$ - 10$^5$ M$_{\\odot}$, and exhibit velocity coherence over their full length. The GMFs we study appear to be inter-arm clouds and may be the Milky Way analogues to spurs obser\n\n3.

That's because there's a lot going on there. Not only is there a supermassive black hole, but also populations of very ancient red giant stars that swarm the center. Most of them date back at least to the formation of the Galaxy. Astronomers used the Canada-France-Hawai'i telescope in Hawaii to study a selection of these stars. They wanted to understand their characteristics and longevity. The observations are part of the \"Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey (PIGS) project. It's been studying the core of the Milky Way for several years now to understand these ancient stars. PIGs Ancient Stars in the Core Other studies have shown that stars began their formation in what's now the core of the Milky Way. The PIGs stars are the remaining members of the \"inner court\" of the Milky Way. They spin slowly around the core and spend most of their lives there. Chemically, they're very different from the younger stars scattered throughout the Galaxy. The oldsters are mostly hydrogen and helium, which indicates they formed at a very early epoch of cosmic history.  By comparison, the younger stars in the Milky Way have higher abundances of \"metals\" such as carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and so on. There are many stars in the Universe itself that formed shortly after the Big Bang from the largely hydrogen- and helium-rich environment. Astronomers can use them as \"templates\" to study stars in our own Milky Way to determine what it was like in its infancy. Typically, such old stars exist in the core region of the Galaxy, and in the swarm of stars that make up a low-density halo around the Milky Way. According to PIGS team memb\n",

G. ; Wardle, M. ; Heywood, I. Abstract We have examined the distribution of the position angle (PA) of the Galactic center filaments with lengths L > 66\u2033 and <66\u2033 as well as their length distribution as a function of PA. We find bimodal PA distributions of the filaments, and long and short populations of radio filaments. Our PA study shows the evidence for a distinct population of short filaments with PA close to the Galactic plane. Mainly thermal, short-radio filaments (<66\u2033) have PAs concentrated close to the Galactic plane within 60\u00b0 < PA < 120\u00b0. Remarkably, the short filament PAs are radial with respect to the Galactic center at l < 0\u00b0 and extend in the direction toward Sgr A*. On a smaller scale, the prominent Sgr E H II complex G358.7-0.0 provides a vivid example of the nearly radial distribution of short filaments. The bimodal PA distribution suggests a different origin for two distinct filament populations. We argue that the alignment of the short-filament population results from the ram pressure of a degree-scale outflow from Sgr A* that exceeds the internal filament pressure, and aligns them along the Galactic plane. The ram pressure is estimated to be 2 \u00d7 10 6 cm -3 K at a distance of 300 pc, requiring biconical mass outflow rate 10 -4 M \u2299 yr -1 with an opening angle of ~40\u00b0. This outflow aligns not only the magnetized filaments along the Galactic plane but also accelerates thermal material associated with embedded or partially embedded clouds. This places an \n\n3.
