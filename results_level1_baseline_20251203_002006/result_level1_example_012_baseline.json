This disconnect with traditional dragons has been bemoaned as ruining the mythic and archetypal power of dragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children's literature than readily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore, from which many children's literature dragons descended, were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories. Modern tamed and human-like children's literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not always life-threatening characters. In specific, two traits borrowed from the original lore inspire uncanny doubling with their human counterparts: the dragons' intensely possessive gaze and their clever, manipulative speech.

While considerable scholarship has focused on dragons in literature, the subject of dragon riders has been neglected, an oversight this article seeks to redress. My research utilises Jonathan D. Evans\u2019 application of Validimir Propp\u2019s Morphology of the Folktale to construct a formula reflecting this narrative pattern. It also draws on human-animal studies, particularly the work of Phillip Armstrong and J. M. Coetzee. Through these theoretical lenses I interrogate the relationship between dragon and rider, exploring how the relationship forms as well as the power dynamic between the participants. Keywords: Dragons, Dragon-riding, Wildness, Human-animal. Biography and contact info: Brendan Sheridan is a PhD student at the University of Waikato, in Hamilton, New Zealand. His Honours dissertation explored interpretations and adaptations of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and his M.A. Thesis The Modern Dragon examined literary and filmic representations of contemporary dragons. The tradition of dragon-slaying, despite being thousands of years old in story, is being supplanted in modern adaptations of the medieval fantasy by a different narrative, that of the dragon-rider. The exploits of dragon slayers such as Saint George, Beowulf, and Marduk have attracted the attention of both creative writers and scholars. Ernest Ingersoll\u2019s Dragonlore, J. R. R. Tolkien\u2019s Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics, and Jacqueline Simpson\u2019s British Dragons are three prominent texts exploring dragons and dragon-slayers. This research on dragon-slaying is complemented by scholarship focusing on dragons in children\u2019s and young adult fiction. As early as the 1970s Bruno Bettelheim discussed the young \n"

Looking at the way these works are influenced by the 1940s pulp science fiction context and Astounding Science Fiction magazine editor John W. Campbell Jr., this article examines their shared sense of continuous urgency or impending crisis. This leads to authoritarian solutions and a recurrent focus on \u201cGreat Man\u201d characters who manipulate the society toward a better future with their enlightened awareness of the workings of history. As this article argues, while the stories justify these manipulations by a sense of urgency, they also create tensions where the manipulations become only temporary solutions and lead to predetermined futures for all but the power elite .

Jyrki Korpua, Hanna-Riikka Roine & P\u00e4ivi V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4nen Editorial 2/2014 The second issue of Fafnir celebrates the multiversum of speculative fiction. It goes without saying that speculative fiction gathers various genres under its umbrella. This fact is well illustrated by the three articles published here, as they move from future histories of Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein to Ings\u2019 rewriting of the mind and to the uncanny dragons in children\u2019s fiction. However, recognising the diversity of speculative fiction does not mean that Fafnir the dragon would just eat up random ingredients and digest them into a meaningless jumble. In all of its multifacetedness, a pattern emerges. Jari K\u00e4kel\u00e4\u2019s article \u201cManaging and Manipulating History: Perpetual Urgency in Asimov and Heinlein\u201d, discusses in an illustrative manner two important works by the central authors of golden age of science fiction: Isaac Asimov\u2019s The Foundation series and Robert Heinlein\u2019s The Man Who Sold the Moon . K\u00e4kel\u00e4 sees that while both authors see history as a result of important actions by a few central characters, Asimov\u2019s \u201cheroes\u201d are more passive, while Heinlein\u2019s characters are more active and disposed towards creating the change themselves.

Looking at the way these works are influenced by the 1940s pulp science fiction context and Astounding Science Fiction magazine editor John W. Campbell Jr., this article examines their shared sense of continuous urgency or impending crisis. This leads to authoritarian solutions and a recurrent focus on \u201cGreat Man\u201d characters who manipulate the society toward a better future with their enlightened awareness of the workings of history. As this article argues, while the stories justify these manipulations by a sense of urgency, they also create tensions where the manipulations become only temporary solutions and lead to predetermined futures for all but the power elite .

Emily Midkiff \u201cDragons are Tricksy\u201d: The Uncanny Dragons of Children\u2019s Literature Abstract : As early as the sixties, scholars of children\u2019s literature have noted a trend to soften and satirize the dragon for children. This disconnect with traditional dragons has been bemoaned as ruining the mythic and archetypal power of dragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children\u2019s literature than readily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore, from which many children\u2019s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories. Modern tamed and human-like children\u2019s literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not always life-threatening characters. In specific, two traits borrowed from the original lore inspire uncanny doubling with their human counterparts: the dragons\u2019 intensely possessive gaze and their clever, manipulative speech.

While considerable scholarship has focused on dragons in literature, the subject of dragon riders has been neglected, an oversight this article seeks to redress. My research utilises Jonathan D. Evans\u2019 application of Validimir Propp\u2019s Morphology of the Folktale to construct a formula reflecting this narrative pattern. It also draws on human-animal studies, particularly the work of Phillip Armstrong and J. M. Coetzee. Through these theoretical lenses I interrogate the relationship between dragon and rider, exploring how the relationship forms as well as the power dynamic between the participants. Keywords: Dragons, Dragon-riding, Wildness, Human-animal. Biography and contact info: Brendan Sheridan is a PhD student at the University of Waikato, in Hamilton, New Zealand. His Honours dissertation explored interpretations and adaptations of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and his M.A. Thesis The Modern Dragon examined literary and filmic representations of contemporary dragons. The tradition of dragon-slaying, despite being thousands of years old in story, is being supplanted in modern adaptations of the medieval fantasy by a different narrative, that of the dragon-rider. The exploits of dragon slayers such as Saint George, Beowulf, and Marduk have attracted the attention of both creative writers and scholars. Ernest Ingersoll\u2019s Dragonlore, J. R. R. Tolkien\u2019s Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics, and Jacqueline Simpson\u2019s British Dragons are three prominent texts exploring dragons and dragon-slayers. This research on dragon-slaying is complemented by scholarship focusing on dragons in children\u2019s and young adult fiction.

The original dragons of Germanic lore, from which many children\u2019s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories. Modern tamed and human-like children\u2019s literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not always life-threatening characters. In specific, two traits borrowed from the original lore inspire uncanny doubling with their human counterparts: the dragons\u2019 intensely possessive gaze and their clever, manipulative speech. This article analyzes these Freudian inheritances to argue that children\u2019s literature dragons have not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for uncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many modern children\u2019s literature dragons. This potential reveals that dragons are still strong characters and can and should be analyzed productively through a Freudian uncanny lens.

Science Fiction Adapted to Film. Gylphi, 2016. ISBN 978-1780240510. It seems that many more people know science fiction through films than through the literary works on which the films are based, which paradoxically contradicts the common axiom concerning cinematic adaptation of text that \u201cthe book is always better than the movie\u201d. Nicholas Ruddick, in his study of a wide range of such adaptations, contributes a useful distinction between science fiction and other fantastic modes of narrative, then uses this distinction to winnow out what would otherwise be a plethora \u2013 that is, an excess \u2013 of both literary texts and cinematic \u201ctexts\u201d derived from them: for Ruddick, science fiction starts with H. G. Wells as the first fabulist to take into account Darwin\u2019s Theory of Evolution as a principle of his speculative fiction. Although this may ruffle the feathers of those who, following Brian Aldiss, regard Mary Shelley as the mother of science fiction and Robert Louis Stevenson as her successor, or even Jules Verne through his meticulously designed futuristic hardware in 20,000 Leagues under the Sea and other adventures, Ruddick makes up for this dismissal of such authors and works from the SF canon by discussing some of the many films that have been inspired by these works of \u201cproto-science fiction\u201d, evidently because of their significance for the genre over the years. Ruddick eschews the term \u201cadaptation\u201d in favor of \u201cremediation\u201d since most of the worthwhile films derived from literary SF texts are what he terms a \u201ctertiary translation\u201d, or translation from one medium (text) to the very differently constituted medium of film \u2013 a \u201cmultitrack audio-visual medium\u201d (16). In his first, and shortest, section, Ruddick discusses the expressed attitudes of SF writers towards film makers and vice-versa, generally arising from\n\n3.

The narrative follows a curious young boy who discovers a mild-mannered, poetry-enthusiast dragon inhabiting a cave in the chalk hills of the English Downs near his family's home; fearing the creature's presence, the villagers summon the knight St. George to slay it according to legend , but the boy intervenes by befriending the reluctant beast and arranging a staged confrontation that resolves the conflict peacefully. [1] [2] Grahame (1859\u20131932), a former banker at the Bank of England , drew from his own childhood experiences in rural England to craft semi-autobiographical tales of imaginative youth, with Dream Days serving as a sequel to his 1895 collection The Golden Age , both featuring the same family of five siblings navigating the wonders and constraints of Victorian childhood. [1] In \"The Reluctant Dragon,\" the dragon emerges as a sensitive, intellectual figure who prefers composing verses to engaging in violence , subverting the traditional monstrous archetype from medieval legends such as the tale of St. George. [2] This portrayal humanizes the mythical creature, emphasizing themes of friendship , empathy , and non- violence , which resonated in late Victorian literature as a gentle critique of rigid social expectations and heroic conventions. [3] The story's enduring appeal lies in its whimsical humor and moral depth, influencing subsequent children's fantasy by reimagining dragons as relatable companions rath\n"

While considerable scholarship has focused on dragons in literature, the subject of dragon riders has been neglected, an oversight this article seeks to redress. My research utilises Jonathan D. Evans\u2019 application of Validimir Propp\u2019s Morphology of the Folktale to construct a formula reflecting this narrative pattern. It also draws on human-animal studies, particularly the work of Phillip Armstrong and J. M. Coetzee. Through these theoretical lenses I interrogate the relationship between dragon and rider, exploring how the relationship forms as well as the power dynamic between the participants. Keywords: Dragons, Dragon-riding, Wildness, Human-animal. Biography and contact info: Brendan Sheridan is a PhD student at the University of Waikato, in Hamilton, New Zealand. His Honours dissertation explored interpretations and adaptations of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and his M.A. Thesis The Modern Dragon examined literary and filmic representations of contemporary dragons. The tradition of dragon-slaying, despite being thousands of years old in story, is being supplanted in modern adaptations of the medieval fantasy by a different narrative, that of the dragon-rider. The exploits of dragon slayers such as Saint George, Beowulf, and Marduk have attracted the attention of both creative writers and scholars. Ernest Ingersoll\u2019s Dragonlore, J. R. R. Tolkien\u2019s Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics, and Jacqueline Simpson\u2019s British Dragons are three prominent texts exploring dragons and dragon-slayers. This research on dragon-slaying is complemented by scholarship focusing on dragons in children\u2019s and young adult fiction. As early as the 1970s Bruno Bettelheim discussed the young \n",

This disconnect with traditional dragons has been bemoaned as ruining the mythic and archetypal power of dragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children\u2019s literature than readily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore, from which many children\u2019s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories. Modern tamed and human-like children\u2019s literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not always life-threatening characters.

This leads to authoritarian solutions and a recurrent focus on \u201cGreat Man\u201d characters who manipulate the society toward a better future with their enlightened awareness of the workings of history.

Jyrki Korpua, Hanna-Riikka Roine & P\u00e4ivi V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4nen Editorial 2/2014 The second issue of Fafnir celebrates the multiversum of speculative fiction. It goes without saying that speculative fiction gathers various genres under its umbrella. This fact is well illustrated by the three articles published here, as they move from future histories of Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein to Ings\u2019 rewriting of the mind and to the uncanny dragons in children\u2019s fiction. However, recognising the diversity of speculative fiction does not mean that Fafnir the dragon would just eat up random ingredients and digest them into a meaningless jumble. In all of its multifacetedness, a pattern emerges. Jari K\u00e4kel\u00e4\u2019s article \u201cManaging and Manipulating History: Perpetual Urgency in Asimov and Heinlein\u201d, discusses in an illustrative manner two important works by the central authors of golden age of science fiction: Isaac Asimov\u2019s The Foundation series and Robert Heinlein\u2019s The Man Who Sold the Moon . K\u00e4kel\u00e4 sees that while both authors see history as a result of important actions by a few central characters, Asimov\u2019s \u201cheroes\u201d are more passive, while Heinlein\u2019s characters are more active and disposed towards creating the change themselves.

The original dragons of Germanic lore, from which many children\u2019s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories. Modern tamed and human-like children\u2019s literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not always life-threatening characters.

This article analyzes these Freudian inheritances to argue that children\u2019s literature dragons have not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for uncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many modern children\u2019s literature dragons. This potential reveals that dragons are still strong charact\n\n3.

While considerable scholarship has focused on dragons in literature, the subject of dragon riders has been neglected, an oversight this article seeks to redress. My research utilises Jonathan D. Evans\u2019 application of Validimir Propp\u2019s Morphology of the Folktale to construct a formula reflecting this narrative pattern. It also draws on human-animal studies, particularly the work of Phillip Armstrong and J. M. Coetzee. Through these theoretical lenses I interrogate the relationship between dragon and rider, exploring how the relationship forms as well as the power dynamic between the participants. Keywords: Dragons, Dragon-riding, Wildness, Human-animal. Biography and contact info: Brendan Sheridan is a PhD student at the University of Waikato, in Hamilton, New Zealand. His Honours dissertation explored interpretations and adaptations of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and his M.A. Thesis The Modern Dragon examined literary and filmic representations of contemporary dragons. The tradition of dragon-slaying, despite being thousands of years old in story, is being supplanted in modern adaptations of the medieval fantasy by a different narrative, that of the dragon-rider.

This disconnect with traditional dragons has been bemoaned as ruining the mythic and archetypal power of dragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children\u2019s literature than readily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore, from which many children\u2019s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories. Modern tamed and human-like children\u2019s literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not always life-threatening characters. In specific, two traits borrowed from the original lore inspire uncanny doubling with their human counterparts: the dragons\u2019 intensely possessive gaze and their clever, manipulative speech. This article analyzes these Freudian inheritances to argue that children\u2019s literature dragons have not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for uncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many modern children\u2019s literature dragons. This potential reveals that dragons are still strong characters and can and should be analyzed productively through a Freudian uncanny lens.

Science Fiction Adapted to Film. Gylphi, 2016. ISBN 978-1780240510. It seems that many more people know science fiction through films than through the literary works on which the films are based, which paradoxically contradicts the common axiom concerning cinematic adaptation of text that \u201cthe book is always better than the movie\u201d. Nicholas Ruddick, in his study of a wide range of such adaptations, contributes a useful distinction between science fiction and other fantastic modes of narrative, then uses this distinction to winnow out what would otherwise be a plethora \u2013 that is, an excess \u2013 of both literary texts and cinematic \u201ctexts\u201d derived from them: for Ruddick, science fiction starts with H. G. Wells as the first fabulist to take into account Darwin\u2019s Theory of Evolution as a principle of his speculative fiction. Although this may ruffle the feathers of those who, following Brian Aldiss, regard Mary Shelley as the mother of science fiction and Robert Louis Stevenson as her successor, or even Jules Verne through his meticulously designed futuristic hardware in 20,000 Leagues under the Sea and other adventures, Ruddick makes up for this dismissal of such authors and works from the SF canon by discussing some of the many films that have been inspired by these works of \u201cproto-science fiction\u201d, evidently because of their significance for the genre over the years. Ruddick eschews the term \u201cadaptation\u201d in favor of \u201cremediation\u201d since most of the worthwhile films derived from literary SF texts are what he terms a \u201ctertiary translation\u201d, or translation from one medium (text) to the very differently constituted medium of film \u2013 a \u201cmultitrack audio-visual medium\u201d (16). In his first, and shortest, section, Ruddick discusses the expressed attitudes of SF writers towards film makers and vice-versa, generally arising from\n\n3.

The narrative follows a curious young boy who discovers a mild-mannered, poetry-enthusiast dragon inhabiting a cave in the chalk hills of the English Downs near his family's home; fearing the creature's presence, the villagers summon the knight St. George to slay it according to legend , but the boy intervenes by befriending the reluctant beast and arranging a staged confrontation that resolves the conflict peacefully. [1] [2] Grahame (1859\u20131932), a former banker at the Bank of England , drew from his own childhood experiences in rural England to craft semi-autobiographical tales of imaginative youth, with Dream Days serving as a sequel to his 1895 collection The Golden Age , both featuring the same family of five siblings navigating the wonders and constraints of Victorian childhood. [1] In \"The Reluctant Dragon,\" the dragon emerges as a sensitive, intellectual figure who prefers composing verses to engaging in violence , subverting the traditional monstrous archetype from medieval legends such as the tale of St. George. [2] This portrayal humanizes the mythical creature, emphasizing themes of friendship , empathy , and non- violence , which resonated in late Victorian literature as a gentle critique of rigid social expectations and heroic conventions. [3] The story's enduring appeal lies in its whimsical humor and moral depth, influencing subsequent children's fantasy by reimagining dragons as relatable companions rath\n",
