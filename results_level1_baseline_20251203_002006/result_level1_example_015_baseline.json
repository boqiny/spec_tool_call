Even though the PhC is structurally imperfect, the existence of leaky modes, determined both theoretically and experimentally in the broad spectral region, implies that an efficient light interaction with a material periodicity occurs in the sample. It is shown that the luminescence emission spectrum of a light source placed directly on the PhC surface can be modified by employing the optical modes of the studied structure. We stress also the impact of intrinsic optical losses of the nan\n\n2.

The study finds that despite structural imperfections, significant light interaction occurs, allowing modification of PL spectra based on optical modes of the PhC. The research also highlights the impact of intrinsic optical losses in diamond on PL alterations, demonstrating the role of guided modes in light extraction and their implications for potentially enhancing optical device performance. ...

Quantum dots' photoluminescence can be modified by aligning their emission with leaky mode\n"

The study finds that despite structural imperfections, significant light interaction occurs, allowing modification of PL spectra based on optical modes of the PhC. The research also highlights the impact of intrinsic optical losses in diamond on PL alterations, demonstrating the role of guided modes in light extraction and their implications for potentially enhancing optical device performance. ... Read more Key takeaways AI Leaky modes exist in structurally imperfect nano-diamond photonic crystal slabs, enhancing light interaction. Quantum dots' photoluminescence can be modified by aligning their emission with leaky mode\n"

Use of an array of metallic nanotips for high charge bunch generation and accelerator applications is also feasible but the small fraction of the emitter tip area limits the quantum efficiency. We therefore propose a submicron-pitch, high-density nanotip array device with a gate electrode, that can support surface-plasmon polaritons. From a theoretical analysis for a device with an asymmetric emitter position, a factor ~30 increased array quantum efficiency is demonstrated.

It is shown that the luminescence emission spectrum of a light source placed directly on the PhC surface can be modified by employing the optical modes of the studied structure.

Use of an array of metallic nanotips for high charge bunch generation and accelerator applications is also feasible but the small fraction of the emitter tip area limits the quantum efficiency. We therefore propose a submicron-pitch, high-density nanotip array device with a gate electrode, that can support surface-plasmon polaritons. From a theoretical analysis for a device with an asymmetric emitter position, a factor ~30 increased array quantum efficiency is demonstrated.
