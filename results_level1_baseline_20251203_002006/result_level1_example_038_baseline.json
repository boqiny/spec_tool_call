Help out Give Sponsor Advertise Create Promote Join Lawyer Directory LII Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 601. Competency to Testify in General Rule 601. Competency to Testify in General Every person is competent to be a witness unless these rules provide otherwise. But in a civil case, state law governs the witness\u2019s competency regarding a claim or defense for which state law supplies the rule of decision. Notes (Pub. L. 93\u2013595, \u00a71, Jan. 2, 1975, 88 Stat. 1934; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.) Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules This general ground-clearing eliminates all grounds  of incompetency not specifically recognized in the succeeding rules of  this Article. Included among the grounds thus abolished are religious  belief, conviction of crime, and connection with the litigation as a  party or interested person or spouse of a party or interested person.  With the exception of the so-called Dead Man's Acts, American  jurisdictions generally have ceased to recognize these grounds.

Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules This general ground-clearing eliminates all grounds  of incompetency not specifically recognized in the succeeding rules of  this Article. Included among the grounds thus abolished are religious  belief, conviction of crime, and connection with the litigation as a  party or interested person or spouse of a party or interested person.  With the exception of the so-called Dead Man's Acts, American  jurisdictions generally have ceased to recognize these grounds. The Dead Man's Acts are surviving traces of the  common law disqualification of parties and interested persons.
