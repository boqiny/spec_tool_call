You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\\n\\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\\n\\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\\n---\\nTask: \\\"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\\\"\\n\\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\\nCode:\\n```py\\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, quest\n",
