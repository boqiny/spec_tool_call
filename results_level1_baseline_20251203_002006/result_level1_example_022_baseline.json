Each dash, \"-\", is a marker indicating a mile. Each capital H indicates a house located next to a mile marker, appearing above or below the stretch of road. Each cell phone tower can cover houses located next to the road within a 4-mile radius. Find the minimum number of cell phone towers needed to cover all houses next to the road.
