During the last five years, I was lucky to have three philosophical godfathers. My biggest debt goes to Julien Deonna. With him, I discovered the joys of analytic philosophy. I discovered also how thinking can be both elegant and intuitive. I also met one of my best friends, someone who took care of me, including my doubts and sorrows, as few supervisors and people would do. I wish to sincerely thank him and I hope that the present work as well as my admiration for him can contribute to doing him justice. My second godfather, to whom I wish to express my gratitude as well, is Gianfranco Soldati. With him, I discovered how thinking can be deep and imaginative at the same time. All along, his supervision helped me clarify my thoughts, with respect and patience. His comments, sweet encouragements and friendship were precious in the elaboration of this work. I wish to sincerely thank him for having been so nice and generous with me all these years. Finally, my last godfather, to whom I owe a great debt as well, is Kevin Mulligan. With his profound comments, his elegance, and his sense of humour, Kevin made the duration of this Ph.D. into five stimulating years of intellectual delight. I wish to thank him as well for his support. In addition to these people, I wish to thank the members of the Thumos research group f\n"

During the last five years, I was lucky to have three philosophical godfathers. My biggest debt goes to Julien Deonna. With him, I discovered the joys of analytic philosophy. I discovered also how thinking can be both elegant and intuitive. I also met one of my best friends, someone who took care of me, including my doubts and sorrows, as few supervisors and people would do. I wish to sincerely thank him and I hope that the present work as well as my admiration for him can contribute to doing him justice. My second godfather, to whom I wish to express my gratitude as well, is Gianfranco Soldati. With him, I discovered how thinking can be deep and imaginative at the same time. All along, his supervision helped me clarify my thoughts, with respect and patience. His comments, sweet encouragements and friendship were precious in the elaboration of this work. I wish to sincerely thank him for having been so nice and generous with me all these years. Finally, my last godfather, to whom I owe a great debt as well, is Kevin Mulligan. With his profound comments, his elegance, and his sense of humour, Kevin made the duration of this Ph.D. into five stimulating years of intellectual delight. I wish to thank him as well for his support. In addition to these people, I wish to thank the members of the Thumos research group f\n",
