It says that it can be morally good to do something that has a bad effect so long as it also has a larger good effect.  Here, \"double effect\" means \"second effect\" or \" side effect .\" In plain English, the principle of double effect means, \"It is acceptable for actions to have bad side effects so long as the good effect is much larger.\" [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] History [ change | change source ] Historians think Thomas Aquinas was the first person to write about the principle of double effect but they are not sure.  Thomas Aquinas lived in the 1200s.  He wrote about killing in self-defense .  Philosophers from before Thomas Aquinas, for example Augustine of Hippo , said it was never acceptable to kill another person, not even in self-defense . \n\n3.

It says that it can be morally good to do something that has a bad effect so long as it also has a larger good effect.  Here, \"double effect\" means \"second effect\" or \" side effect .\" In plain English, the principle of double effect means, \"It is acceptable for actions to have bad side effects so long as the good effect is much larger.\" [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] History [ change | change source ] Historians think Thomas Aquinas was the first person to write about the principle of double effect but they are not sure.  Thomas Aquinas lived in the 1200s.  He wrote about killing in self-defense .  Philosophers from before Thomas Aquinas, for example Augustine of Hippo , said it was never acceptable to kill another person, not even in self-defense . \n\n3.
