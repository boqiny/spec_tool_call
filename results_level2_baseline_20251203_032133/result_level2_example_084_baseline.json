Shows listed here include special exhibitions drawn exclusively from the Museum's own collections, shows of objects loaned by other institutions or collectors, and combinations of both. Gallery rotations or new installations of permanent holdings are not included. This list includes exhibitions at the main Museum building, The Cloisters, and The Breuer, and does not record information on Met-sponsored shows held at other national or international venues. The public opening and closing dates for each exhibition have been listed when it has been possible to determine them from available archival sources. These dates may not always correspond with the dates printed in catalogues due to delayed openings, extended runs of shows, cancellations or other changes after catalogues were printed. The list is sorted chronologically by opening date and each exhibition appears only once, even if its run extended over more than one calendar year. Please note that this is a working document. For complete accuracy, information should be verified against primary source documents in the Museum Archives or Museum publications in the Watson Library. We welcome suggestions, corrections or information regarding any Museum exhibitions that may not appear here. Please direct your comments to archives@metmuseum.org.

The association of these creatures with the Chinese calendar began in the third century B.C. and became firmly established by the first century A.D. The 12 animals are, in sequence: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, ram, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig. Each is believed to embody certain traits that are manifested in the personalities of the people born in that year. This Lunar New Year, which begins on February 12, 2021, is the Year of the Ox. In celebration of the Year of the Ox, this exhibition presents depictions of oxen and water buffalo (considered the same category of animals in China) created by artists in the last 3,000 years. Particularly notable are a massive eighteenth-century jade sculpture of a water buffalo and a remarkable eighth-century set of ceramic Chinese zodiac figures, illustrating the important role that the animals play in the life of humans. The exhibition is made possible by the Joseph Hotung Fund. January 30, 2021\u2013January 17, 2022 Previously on view at The Met Fifth Avenue in Gallery 207 Exhibitions are free with Museum admission.

Shows listed here include special exhibitions drawn exclusively from the Museum's own collections, shows of objects loaned by other institutions or collectors, and combinations of both. Gallery rotations or new installations of permanent holdings are not included. This list includes exhibitions at the main Museum building, The Cloisters, and The Breuer, and does not record information on Met-sponsored shows held at other national or international venues. The public opening and closing dates for each exhibition have been listed when it has been possible to determine them from available archival sources. These dates may not always correspond with the dates printed in catalogues due to delayed openings, extended runs of shows, cancellations or other changes after catalogues were printed. The list is sorted chronologically by opening date and each exhibition appears only once, even if its run extended over more than one calendar year. Please note that this is a working document. For complete accuracy, information should be verified against primary source documents in the Museum Archives or Museum publications in the Watson Library. We welcome suggestions, corrections or information regarding any Museum exhibitions that may not appear here. Please direct your comments to archives@metmuseum.org.

The association of these creatures with the Chinese calendar began in the third century B.C. and became firmly established by the first century A.D. The 12 animals are, in sequence: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, ram, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig. Each is believed to embody certain traits that are manifested in the personalities of the people born in that year. This Lunar New Year, which begins on February 12, 2021, is the Year of the Ox. In celebration of the Year of the Ox, this exhibition presents depictions of oxen and water buffalo (considered the same category of animals in China) created by artists in the last 3,000 years. Particularly notable are a massive eighteenth-century jade sculpture of a water buffalo and a remarkable eighth-century set of ceramic Chinese zodiac figures, illustrating the important role that the animals play in the life of humans. The exhibition is made possible by the Joseph Hotung Fund. January 30, 2021\u2013January 17, 2022 Previously on view at The Met Fifth Avenue in Gallery 207 Exhibitions are free with Museum admission.

For the first time, this book weaves together the cultural histories of the cities along the great incense and silk routes that connected southwestern Arabia, Nabataea, Judaea, Syria, and Mesopotamia. It captures the intricate web of influence and religious diversity that emerged in the Middle East through the exchange of goods and ideas. And for our current age, when several of the archaeological sites featured here\u2014including Palmyra, Dura- Europos, and Hatra\u2014have been subject to deliberate destruction and looting, it addresses the crucial subject of preserving what has been lost and contextualizes the significance of these works on a local and global scale. Jacket illustrations: (front) Aedicula for Aglibol and Malakbel This essential volume features 186 objects of exceptional (cat. 102, detail); (back) The Royal Tombs, Petra (fig. 23, detail) importance from Europe, the Middle East, and the United States.
