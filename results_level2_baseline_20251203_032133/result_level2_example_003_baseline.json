Instead, the ` prefix operator is used to apply a function to an argument; if f and x are expressions, then ` fx is an expression that applies f to the argument x . Other than this operator, every other element of the language is essentially a combinator , denoting a function taking exactly one other function as argument and returning another. For example, the combinator S I I (S I I) , which reduces to itself, could be encoded with the following Unlambda expression: ```sii``sii Combinators The following combinators are defined: s takes three arguments (via currying) and applies each of the first two to the third and applies those to each other and returns the result, that is, ```sxyz evaluates to ``xz`yz. k takes two arguments (via currying) and returns the first. i takes one argument and returns it. v takes one argument and returns v. . x (where x is any character) takes one argument and returns it, with the \"side effect\" of printing x . r is an abbreviation for . newline . d as a function simply takes two arguments and applies the first to the second, but in an expression it has a special effect: the second argument must be evaluated before the first. While d has only one argument, that argument is not evaluated. (For example, ``d`.xi`.yi evaluates `.yi first , outputting y and returning i. Now since the second argument has been evaluated, d acts like the identity function i, \n\n3.
