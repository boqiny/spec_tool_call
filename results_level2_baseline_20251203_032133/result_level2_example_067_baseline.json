It captures the natural phenomena called a \u201cproton arc\u201d (aurora) as it silhouetted against a beautiful starry sky. NASA describes the photo as follows: The setting had been picked out \u2014 all that was needed was an aurora.

Jumping into his truck, the astrophotographer approached his secret site \u2014 but only after a five hour drive across the rural Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

The red arc lasted only about 15 minutes, but that was long enough to capture in a 30-second exposure. As the name indicates, proton arcs are caused not by electrons but by more massive protons that bombard the Earth\u2019s atmosphere following an energetic event on the Sun.
