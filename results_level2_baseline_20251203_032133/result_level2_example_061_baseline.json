Itinvolvesnavigatingdiverseknowledgespacesandreasoning 013 overcomplex,multi-stepdependencies,whichpresentssubstantialchallengesfor 014 agentic systems. To address this, we propose InternAgent-DR (Deep Research), 015 a multi-agent framework that actively constructs and evolves a dynamic struc- tured knowledge flow to drive subtask execution and reasoning. InternAgent- 016 DR is capable of strategically planning and expanding the knowledge flow to 017 enable parallel exploration and hierarchical task decomposition, while also ad- 018 justingtheknowledgeflowinrealtimebasedonfeedbackfromintermediaterea- 019 soning outcomes and insights. InternAgent-DR achieves state-of-the-art perfor- 020 manceonbothgeneralandscientificbenchmarks,includingGAIA,HLE,GPQA 021 and TRQA, demonstrating its effectiveness in multi-disciplinary research sce- 022 narios and its potential to advance scientific discovery.

Itinvolvesnavigatingdiverseknowledgespacesandreasoning 013 overcomplex,multi-stepdependencies,whichpresentssubstantialchallengesfor 014 agentic systems. To address this, we propose InternAgent-DR (Deep Research), 015 a multi-agent framework that actively constructs and evolves a dynamic struc- tured knowledge flow to drive subtask execution and reasoning. InternAgent- 016 DR is capable of strategically planning and expanding the knowledge flow to 017 enable parallel exploration and hierarchical task decomposition, while also ad- 018 justingtheknowledgeflowinrealtimebasedonfeedbackfromintermediaterea- 019 soning outcomes and insights. InternAgent-DR achieves state-of-the-art perfor- 020 manceonbothgeneralandscientificbenchmarks,includingGAIA,HLE,GPQA 021 and TRQA, demonstrating its effectiveness in multi-disciplinary research sce- 022 narios and its potential to advance scientific discovery.
