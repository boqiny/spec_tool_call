World Building Edited by Marta Boni World Building Transmedia, Fans, IndustriesWorld BuildingTransmedia: Participatory Culture and Media Convergence The book series Transmedia: Participatory Culture and Media Convergence provides a platform for cutting-edge research in the field of media studies, with a strong focus on the impact of digitization, globalization, and fan culture. The series is dedicated to publishing the highest-quality monographs (and exceptional edited collections) on the developing social, cultural, and economic practices surrounding media convergence and audience participation. The term \u2018media convergence\u2019 relates to the complex ways in which the production, distribution, and consumption of contemporary media are affected by digitization, while \u2018participatory culture\u2019 refers to the changing relationship between media producers and their audiences. Interdisciplinary by its very definition, the series will provide a publishing platform for international scholars doing new and critical research in relevant fields. While the main focus will be on contemporary media culture, the series is also open to research that focuses on the historical forebears of digital convergence culture, including histories of fandom, cross- and transmedia franchises, reception studies and audience ethnographies, and critical approaches to the culture industry and commodity culture.

Yet a full-fl edged, system- atic study on how games can break fourth walls, create metaleptic transgressions and more generally refer to, parody and problematize their own gameness has long been overdue. Krampe\u2019s diligent work delights as much as it enlightens not only the critical, postmodern and/o r scholarly reader/p layer in us, but indeed anyone wishing to understand the unique creative and literally game-c hanging affordances of a medium more often misunderstood for its apparently one-s ided effects than appreciated for its ultimate complexity and innate, deep metareferentiality.\u201d - Prof. Dr. Astrid Ensslin, Director of DAS|LAB, University of RegensburgMetareference in Videogames Taking an original, in- depth approach, this book investigates the forms and functions of metareference in videogames. Drawing on a rich body of research in game studies, transmedial narratology, and neighbouring disciplines, the author combines detailed close-r eading- style analyses of the indie games What Remains of Edith Finch, The Magic Circle and OneShot with a breadth of examples and systematic analyses that span multiple genres as well as several decades of videogaming. In doing so, the book maps different metareferential elements that can be found in videogames and proposes an original model for their analysis, while showcasing the complex interrelations among different metareferential ele\n\n3.

On the one hand, the transgression of narrative levels or fictional worlds (as well as their \u201cconfusion\u201d) may compromise the \u201csuspension of disbelief\u201d and rupture the fictional pact; on the other hand, when the \u201creality system\u201d depicted within a narrative collapses, characters, as well as readers or viewers, are forced to question the distinction between fiction and reality and to interrogate the \u201cstatus\u201d of the worlds they inhabit, with a profound sense of \u201contological\u201d vertigo.\nThe main aim of my paper is to discuss how, in the contemporary context of convergence, transmedia storytelling and participatory culture, metalepsis produces a third, fundamental \u201contological\u201d effect. More precisely, metalepsis may strengthen the illusionistic effect and create a \u201c\n\n2. The Monster at the End of This Book.

My paper will be structured into three parts: first, I will provide a definition of the above mentioned strategies, including their main effects; second, I will discuss how the relationships between the use of these strategies, the participatory or networked culture of fandom and world-making practices can be interpreted and analyzed; and finally, I will focus on the case of the TV series Supernatural. ...

World Building Edited by Marta Boni World Building Transmedia, Fans, IndustriesWorld BuildingTransmedia: Participatory Culture and Media Convergence The book series Transmedia: Participatory Culture and Media Convergence provides a platform for cutting-edge research in the field of media studies, with a strong focus on the impact of digitization, globalization, and fan culture. The series is dedicated to publishing the highest-quality monographs (and exceptional edited collections) on the developing social, cultural, and economic practices surrounding media convergence and audience participation. The term \u2018media convergence\u2019 relates to the complex ways in which the production, distribution, and consumption of contemporary media are affected by digitization, while \u2018participatory culture\u2019 refers to the changing relationship between media producers and their audiences. Interdisciplinary by its very definition, the series will provide a publishing platform for international scholars doing new and critical research in relevant fields. While the main focus will be on contemporary media culture, the series is also open to research that focuses on the historical forebears of digital convergence culture, including histories of fandom, cross- and transmedia franchises, reception studies and audience ethnographies, and critical approaches to the culture industry and commodity culture.

Yet a full-fl edged, system- atic study on how games can break fourth walls, create metaleptic transgressions and more generally refer to, parody and problematize their own gameness has long been overdue. Krampe\u2019s diligent work delights as much as it enlightens not only the critical, postmodern and/o r scholarly reader/p layer in us, but indeed anyone wishing to understand the unique creative and literally game-c hanging affordances of a medium more often misunderstood for its apparently one-s ided effects than appreciated for its ultimate complexity and innate, deep metareferentiality.\u201d - Prof. Dr. Astrid Ensslin, Director of DAS|LAB, University of RegensburgMetareference in Videogames Taking an original, in- depth approach, this book investigates the forms and functions of metareference in videogames. Drawing on a rich body of research in game studies, transmedial narratology, and neighbouring disciplines, the author combines detailed close-r eading- style analyses of the indie games What Remains of Edith Finch, The Magic Circle and OneShot with a breadth of examples and systematic analyses that span multiple genres as well as several decades of videogaming. In doing so, the book maps different metareferential elements that can be found in videogames and proposes an original model for their analysis, while showcasing the complex interrelations among different metareferential ele\n\n3.

On the one hand, the transgression of narrative levels or fictional worlds (as well as their \u201cconfusion\u201d) may compromise the \u201csuspension of disbelief\u201d and rupture the fictional pact; on the other hand, when the \u201creality system\u201d depicted within a narrative collapses, characters, as well as readers or viewers, are forced to question the distinction between fiction and reality and to interrogate the \u201cstatus\u201d of the worlds they inhabit, with a profound sense of \u201contological\u201d vertigo.\nThe main aim of my paper is to discuss how, in the contemporary context of convergence, transmedia storytelling and participatory culture, metalepsis produces a third, fundamental \u201contological\u201d effect. More precisely, metalepsis may strengthen the illusionistic effect and create a \u201c\n\n2. The Monster at the End of This Book.

My paper will be structured into three parts: first, I will provide a definition of the above mentioned strategies, including their main effects; second, I will discuss how the relationships between the use of these strategies, the participatory or networked culture of fandom and world-making practices can be interpreted and analyzed; and finally, I will focus on the case of the TV series Supernatural. ...

World Building Edited by Marta Boni World Building Transmedia, Fans, IndustriesWorld BuildingTransmedia: Participatory Culture and Media Convergence The book series Transmedia: Participatory Culture and Media Convergence provides a platform for cutting-edge research in the field of media studies, with a strong focus on the impact of digitization, globalization, and fan culture. The series is dedicated to publishing the highest-quality monographs (and exceptional edited collections) on the developing social, cultural, and economic practices surrounding media convergence and audience participation. The term \u2018media convergence\u2019 relates to the complex ways in which the production, distribution, and consumption of contemporary media are affected by digitization, while \u2018participatory culture\u2019 refers to the changing relationship between media producers and their audiences. Interdisciplinary by its very definition, the series will provide a publishing platform for international scholars doing new and critical research in relevant fields. While the main focus will be on contemporary media culture, the series is also open to research that focuses on the historical forebears of digital convergence culture, including histories of fandom, cross- and transmedia franchises, reception studies and audience ethnographies, and critical approaches to the culture industry and commodity culture.
