New scientific findings give raise to fears that climate change is progressing even faster than expected, which means that even within the lifetime of existing nuclear power plants the effects will be much more dramatic than previously assumed. Those effects can lead on the one hand to a drop in the efficiency and an increase in the frequency and duration of outages, and on the other hand safety relevant effects are possible. This must be taken into account when designing new plants and retrofitting existing nuclear power plants. Moreover, both climate change itself and the measures taken to mitigate it may trigger social, societal and political developments, in the worst case armed conflicts, which means an enormous additional risk potential for nuclear facilities.. All of this therefore needs to be included in nuclear power plants vulnerability analysis. Given the urgency of decarbonising the energy system, preference should be given to other, more readily available, less risky technologies in order to avoid the delays that have been shown to result from diversions of capacity and investment in nuclear power.Starting point Nuclear power plants are in principle designed to withstand the extreme weather conditions of the respective sites. All regulatory requirements in this regard are based on long-term weather statistics from the past, which no longer reflect today's weather situations, let alone those that can be expected during the remaining lifetime of the plants in operation or new plants to be built, as most nuclear power plants were built in the late 1960s to the early 1980s1 - i.e. before climate change became significant2. These nuclear power plants are therefore confronted with unexpected weather conditions in terms of intensity, extent or frequency. E\n"

It\u2019s abundantly clear that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has found that nuclear energy is essential for preventing climate change\u2026but only if you read the 2000+ page Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) on the mitigation of climate change . If instead you, like many others, only read the 42-page AR6 Synthesis Report\u2019s Summary for Policymakers , you are probably wondering if you missed something because nuclear energy is only mentioned once and that single mention is squeezed within a densely populated table that in no way acknowledges its importance for greenhouse gas reduction. This discrepancy has been highlighted in a recent blog post by Karl Hausker, Senior Fellow at the World Resources Institute, and it begs the questions: How can nuclear be such an important tool in our decarbonization tool belt and be missing from the Summary for Policymakers? Isn\u2019t the generation mix required to reach our climate targets exactly what policymakers need to know so they are able to make informed decisions on what clean energy technologies to support? The answers to these questions may surprise and disappoint you. Nuclear energy was omitted from the AR6 Summary for Policymakers because several of the countries that determine what is included in that summary chose to downpla\n\n3.

New scientific findings give raise to fears that climate change is progressing even faster than expected, which means that even within the lifetime of existing nuclear power plants the effects will be much more dramatic than previously assumed. Those effects can lead on the one hand to a drop in the efficiency and an increase in the frequency and duration of outages, and on the other hand safety relevant effects are possible. This must be taken into account when designing new plants and retrofitting existing nuclear power plants. Moreover, both climate change itself and the measures taken to mitigate it may trigger social, societal and political developments, in the worst case armed conflicts, which means an enormous additional risk potential for nuclear facilities.. All of this therefore needs to be included in nuclear power plants vulnerability analysis. Given the urgency of decarbonising the energy system, preference should be given to other, more readily available, less risky technologies in order to avoid the delays that have been shown to result from diversions of capacity and investment in nuclear power.Starting point Nuclear power plants are in principle designed to withstand the extreme weather conditions of the respective sites. All regulatory requirements in this regard are based on long-term weather statistics from the past, which no longer reflect today's weather situations, let alone those that can be expected during the remaining lifetime of the plants in operation or new plants to be built, as most nuclear power plants were built in the late 1960s to the early 1980s1 - i.e. before climate change became significant2. These nuclear power plants are therefore confronted with unexpected weather conditions in terms of intensity, extent or frequency. E\n",

It\u2019s abundantly clear that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has found that nuclear energy is essential for preventing climate change\u2026but only if you read the 2000+ page Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) on the mitigation of climate change . If instead you, like many others, only read the 42-page AR6 Synthesis Report\u2019s Summary for Policymakers , you are probably wondering if you missed something because nuclear energy is only mentioned once and that single mention is squeezed within a densely populated table that in no way acknowledges its importance for greenhouse gas reduction. This discrepancy has been highlighted in a recent blog post by Karl Hausker, Senior Fellow at the World Resources Institute, and it begs the questions: How can nuclear be such an important tool in our decarbonization tool belt and be missing from the Summary for Policymakers? Isn\u2019t the generation mix required to reach our climate targets exactly what policymakers need to know so they are able to make informed decisions on what clean energy technologies to support? The answers to these questions may surprise and disappoint you. Nuclear energy was omitted from the AR6 Summary for Policymakers because several of the countries that determine what is included in that summary chose to downpla\n\n3.
