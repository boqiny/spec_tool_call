Despite the ominous (some might say fatalistic) name, the book is actually a celebration of the best dishes that are unique to this country. The Sterns, who have been focusing on quirky All-American food haunts since 1977, describe in delicious detail, the best dishes proffered at roadside stands, cafes, street carts throughout the fruited plain. Farolitos Festoon the Path to the Bar In an interview with the Wall Street Journal , Michael Stern was asked if the inclusion of the words \u201c too late \u201d in the book\u2019s title referred to the \u201c death of the small eatery, or the reader\u2019s impending doom from eating too much fried chicken, French fries and fried fish .\u201d He indicated he was referring to \u201c the impending onslaught of the nutrition police who will make all of this stuff illegal one of these days .\u201d He also warned of the loss of \u201csome variety and some local specialties that were once easy to find and are now hard or impossible to find due to chain restaurants.\u201d One of Papa Felipe\u2019s Dining Rooms Despite the onslaught of the ubiquitous national food chain, Stern was optimistic that \u201cAmericans have become mor\n\n2. 500 Things To Eat Before It's Too Late: and the Very Best Places to ...\n   URL: https://www.amazon.com/500-Things-Eat-Before-Late/dp/0547059078\n   Site: amazon.com\n   Summary: When \"bests\" abound--hot dogs, hamburgers, pizza, apple pie, doughnuts--the Sterns rank their offerings.

Four new FOGs (including one delightful ruffian)\u2013Dale, Shirley, Lea and Stephanie\u2013fit right in with what has become a rather tight-knit cast of characters. In addition to breaking sopaipillas and tortillas, some of Albuquerque\u2019s most passionate and knowledgeable foodies were seen oohing and aahing\u201d at photos being passed around the table of our four-legged children.  Something else we have in common, it appears, is the love of dogs of all breeds and sizes.   Overheard were conversations centering around such diverse topics as anthropological linguistics, travel, photography and of course, food. The lull after a very satisfying meal Jen observed that the far northeast heights isn\u2019t often an area of the city you\u2019d associate with great New Mexican food.  Papa Felipe\u2019s changed a few minds and awoke several of us to the infinite possibilities of New Mexican standards that are \u201cjust a bit different.\u201d  Papa Felipe\u2019\n"

Four new FOGs (including one delightful ruffian)\u2013Dale, Shirley, Lea and Stephanie\u2013fit right in with what has become a rather tight-knit cast of characters. In addition to breaking sopaipillas and tortillas, some of Albuquerque\u2019s most passionate and knowledgeable foodies were seen oohing and aahing\u201d at photos being passed around the table of our four-legged children.  Something else we have in common, it appears, is the love of dogs of all breeds and sizes.   Overheard were conversations centering around such diverse topics as anthropological linguistics, travel, photography and of course, food. The lull after a very satisfying meal Jen observed that the far northeast heights isn\u2019t often an area of the city you\u2019d associate with great New Mexican food.  Papa Felipe\u2019s changed a few minds and awoke several of us to the infinite possibilities of New Mexican standards that are \u201cjust a bit different.\u201d  Papa Felipe\u2019\n",
