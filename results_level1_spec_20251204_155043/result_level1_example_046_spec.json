This paradigm introduces unique challenges for LLMs\u2019 agentic reasoning capabilities wheninteractingwithretrievalsystemsandthebroaderweb. Inthispaper, weproposeanLLM- basedpipelinetostudyeffectivereasoningbehaviorpatternsinagenticsearchbycomparingand analyzingsuccessfulandunsuccessfultrajectories. Usingthispipeline,weidentifyfourbeneficial reasoningbehaviors: InformationVerification,AuthorityEvaluation,AdaptiveSearch,andError Recovery. Based on these findings, we propose a technique called Behavior Priming to train agenticsearchmodels. Itsynthesizestrajectoriesthatexhibitthesefourbehaviorsandintegrates them into the agentic search model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by standard reinforcementlearning(RL).ExperimentsonQwen3-1.7BandLlama3.2-3B-Instructacrossthree webbenchmarksandsevenmulti-hopQAbenchmarksdemonstratethatbehaviorpriming1)yields significantperformancegainscomparedtotrainingmodelswithRLdirectly, and2)outperforms otherSFT-then-RLbaselines,suchasthoseSFTonrandomlyselectedtrajectoriesorontrajectories withmerelycorrectoutcomes. Crucially,wedemonstratethatthedesiredreasoningbehaviorsin the SFT data, rather than the correctness of the final answer, is the critical factor for achieving strongfinalperformanceinRL:SFTontrajectorieswithreasoningbehaviorsbutincorrectanswers leadstocomparableperformancewithSFTonthosewithreasoningbehaviorsandcorrectanswers.
