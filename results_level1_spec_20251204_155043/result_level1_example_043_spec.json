Nearsighted to the point of being legally blind, and the youngest of three daughters (her sisters named Phyllis and Helen), Lorde grew up hearing her mother's stories about the West Indies. She learned to talk while she learned to read, at the age of four, and her mother taught her to write at around the same time. She wrote her first poem when she was in eighth grade. Born Audrey Geraldine Lorde, she chose to drop the \"y\" from her name while still a child, explaining in Zami: A New Spelling of My Name, that she was more interested in the artistic symmetry of the \"e\"-endings in the two side-by-side names \"Audre Lorde\" than in spelling her name the way her parents had intended. After graduating from Hunter College High School and experiencing the grief of her best friend Genevieve \"Gennie\" Thompson's death, Lorde immediately left her parents' home and became estranged from her family. She attended Hunter College from 1954 to 1959 and graduated with a bachelor's degree. While studying library science, Lorde supported herself by working various odd jobs such as factory worker, ghost writer, social worker, X-ray technician, medical clerk, and arts and crafts supervisor, moving out of Harlem to Stamford, Connecticut and beginning to explore her lesbian sexuality. In 1954, she spent a pivotal year as a student at the National University of Mexico, a period she described as a time of affirmation and renewal: she confirmed her identity on personal and artistic levels as a lesbian and poet.

Bitter, glory-less despotism Over a discouraged people Closes a black thick grate Of error and prejudice; It locks up the loyal swarm Of firm thinkers, of heroes, But the Idea with the flap of a wing Will part the heavy bars, And, as in ninety-one, Will retake sovereign flight, For breaking apart a cage of bronze Is easy for bronze bird. Darkness covers the world, But the Idea illuminates and shines; With its white brightness it floods The dark blues of the night. It is the solitary lantern, The providential ray; It is the lamp of the earth That cannot help but light the sky. ... by Victor Marie Hugo Read Poem POEM OF THE DAY - MODERN POEM Introduction To Poetry I ask them to take a poem and hold it up to the light like a color slide or press an ear against its hive.

Nearsighted to the point of being legally blind, and the youngest of three daughters (her sisters named Phyllis and Helen), Lorde grew up hearing her mother's stories about the West Indies. She learned to talk while she learned to read, at the age of four, and her mother taught her to write at around the same time. She wrote her first poem when she was in eighth grade. Born Audrey Geraldine Lorde, she chose to drop the \"y\" from her name while still a child, explaining in Zami: A New Spelling of My Name, that she was more interested in the artistic symmetry of the \"e\"-endings in the two side-by-side names \"Audre Lorde\" than in spelling her name the way her parents had intended. After graduating from Hunter College High School and experiencing the grief of her best friend Genevieve \"Gennie\" Thompson's death, Lorde immediately left her parents' home and became estranged from her family. She attended Hunter College from 1954 to 1959 and graduated with a bachelor's degree. While studying library science, Lorde supported herself by working various odd jobs such as factory worker, ghost writer, social worker, X-ray technician, medical clerk, and arts and crafts supervisor, moving out of Harlem to Stamford, Connecticut and beginning to explore her lesbian sexuality. In 1954, she spent a pivotal year as a student at the National University of Mexico, a period she described as a time of affirmation and renewal: she confirmed her identity on personal and artistic levels as a lesbian and poet.

Bitter, glory-less despotism Over a discouraged people Closes a black thick grate Of error and prejudice; It locks up the loyal swarm Of firm thinkers, of heroes, But the Idea with the flap of a wing Will part the heavy bars, And, as in ninety-one, Will retake sovereign flight, For breaking apart a cage of bronze Is easy for bronze bird. Darkness covers the world, But the Idea illuminates and shines; With its white brightness it floods The dark blues of the night.

Nearsighted to the point of being legally blind, and the youngest of three daughters (her sisters named Phyllis and Helen), Lorde grew up hearing her mother's stories about the West Indies. She learned to talk while she learned to read, at the age of four, and her mother taught her to write at around the same time. She wrote her first poem when she was in eighth grade. Born Audrey Geraldine Lorde, she chose to drop the \"y\" from her name while still a child, explaining in Zami: A New Spelling of My Name, that she was more interested in the artistic symmetry of the \"e\"-endings in the two side-by-side names \"Audre Lorde\" than in spelling her name the way her parents had intended.

Bitter, glory-less despotism Over a discouraged people Closes a black thick grate Of error and prejudice; It locks up the loyal swarm Of firm thinkers, of heroes, But the Idea with the flap of a wing Will part the heavy bars, And, as in ninety-one, Will retake sovereign flight, For breaking apart a cage of bronze Is easy for bronze bird. Darkness covers the world, But the Idea illuminates and shines; With its white brightness it floods The dark blues of the night. It is the solitary lantern, The providential ray; It is the lamp of the earth That cannot help but light the sky. ... by Victor Marie Hugo Read Poem POEM OF THE DAY - MODERN POEM Introduction To Poetry I ask them to take a poem and hold it up to the light like a color slide or press an ear against its hive.
