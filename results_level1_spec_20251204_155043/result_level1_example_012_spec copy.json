Emily Midkiff \u201cDragons are Tricksy\u201d: The Uncanny Dragons of Children\u2019s Literature Abstract : As early as the sixties, scholars of children\u2019s literature have noted a trend to soften and satirize the dragon for children. This disconnect with traditional dragons has been bemoaned as ruining the mythic and archetypal power of dragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children\u2019s literature than readily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore, from which many children\u2019s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories. Modern tamed and human-like children\u2019s literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not always life-threatening characters. In specific, two traits borrowed from the original lore inspire uncanny doubling with their human counterparts: the dragons\u2019 intensely possessive gaze and their clever, manipulative speech.

Looking at the way these works are influenced by the 1940s pulp science fiction context and Astounding Science Fiction magazine editor John W. Campbell Jr., this article examines their shared sense of continuous urgency or impending crisis. This leads to authoritarian solutions and a recurrent focus on \u201cGreat Man\u201d characters who manipulate the society toward a better future with their enlightened awareness of the workings of history. As this article argues, while the stories justify these manipulations by a sense of urgency, they also create tensions where the manipulations become only temporary solutions and lead to predetermined futures for all but the power elite .

Looking at the way these works are influenced by the 1940s pulp science fiction context and Astounding Science Fiction magazine editor John W. Campbell Jr., this article examines their shared sense of continuous urgency or impending crisis. This leads to authoritarian solutions and a recurrent focus on \u201cGreat Man\u201d characters who manipulate the society toward a better future with their enlightened awareness of the workings of history. As this article argues, while the stories justify these manipulations by a sense of urgency, they also create tensions where the manipulations become only temporary solutions and lead to predetermined futures for all but the power elite .

This disconnect with traditional dragons has been bemoaned as ruining the mythic and archetypal power of dragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children\u2019s literature than readily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore, from which many children\u2019s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories. Modern tamed and human-like children\u2019s literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not always life-threatening characters. In specific, two traits borrowed from the original lore inspire uncanny doubling with their human counterparts: the dragons\u2019 intensely possessive gaze and their clever, manipulative speech. This article analyzes these Freudian inheritances to argue that children\u2019s literature dragons have not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for uncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many modern children\u2019s literature dragons. This potential reveals that dragons are still strong characters and can and should be analyzed productively through a Freudian uncanny lens.

Ruddick, Nicholas ...\n   Content: Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research journal.finfar.org Book-Review: Science Fiction Adapted to Film Don Riggs Ruddick, Nicholas. Science Fiction Adapted to Film. Gylphi, 2016. ISBN 978-1780240510. It seems that many more people know science fiction through films than through the literary works on which the films are based, which paradoxically contradicts the common axiom concerning cinematic adaptation of text that \u201cthe book is always better than the movie\u201d. Nicholas Ruddick, in his study of a wide range of such adaptations, contributes a useful distinction between science fiction and other fantastic modes of narrative, then uses this distinction to winnow out what would otherwise be a plethora \u2013 that is, an excess \u2013 of both literary texts and cinematic \u201ctexts\u201d derived from them: for Ruddick, science fiction starts with H. G. Wells as the first fabulist to take into account Darwin\u2019s Theory of Evolution as a principle of his speculative fiction. Although this may ruffle the feathers of those who, following Brian Aldiss, regard Mary Shelley as the mother of science fiction and Robert Louis Stevenson as her successor, or even Jules Verne through his meticulously designed futuristic hardware in 20,000 Leagues under the Sea and other adventures, Ruddick makes up for this dismissal of such authors and works from the SF canon by discussing some of the many films that have been inspired by these works of \u201cproto-science fiction\u201d, evidently because of their significance for the genre over the years. Ruddick eschews the term \u201cadaptation\u201d in favor of \u201cremediation\u201d since most of the worthwhile films derived from literary SF texts are what he terms a \u201ctertiary translation\u201d, or translation from one medium (text) to the very differently constituted medium of film \u2013 a \u201cmultitrack audio-visual medium\u201d (16). In his first, and shortest, section, Ruddick discusses the expressed attitudes of SF writers towards film makers and vice-versa, generally arising from\n\n3.

The narrative follows a curious young boy who discovers a mild-mannered, poetry-enthusiast dragon inhabiting a cave in the chalk hills of the English Downs near his family's home; fearing the creature's presence, the villagers summon the knight St. George to slay it according to legend , but the boy intervenes by befriending the reluctant beast and arranging a staged confrontation that resolves the conflict peacefully. [1] [2] Grahame (1859\u20131932), a former banker at the Bank of England , drew from his own childhood experiences in rural England to craft semi-autobiographical tales of imaginative youth, with Dream Days serving as a sequel to his 1895 collection The Golden Age , both featuring the same family of five siblings navigating the wonders and constraints of Victorian childhood. [1] In \"The Reluctant Dragon,\" the dragon emerges as a sensitive, intellectual figure who prefers composing verses to engaging in violence , subverting the traditional monstrous archetype from medieval legends such as the tale of St. George. [2] This portrayal humanizes the mythical creature, emphasizing themes of friendship , empathy , and non- violence , which resonated in late Victorian literature as a gentle critique of rigid social expectations and heroic conventions. [3] The story's enduring appeal lies in its whimsical humor and moral depth, influencing subsequent children's fantasy by reimagining dragons as relatable companions rathe\n"

This disconnect with traditional dragons has been bemoaned as ruining the mythic and archetypal power of dragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children\u2019s literature than readily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore, from which many children\u2019s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories. Modern tamed and human-like children\u2019s literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not always life-threatening characters. In specific, two traits borrowed from the original lore inspire uncanny doubling with their human counterparts: the dragons\u2019 intensely possessive gaze and their clever, manipulative speech. This article analyzes these Freudian inheritances to argue that children\u2019s literature dragons have not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for uncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many modern children\u2019s literature dragons. This potential reveals that dragons are still strong characters and can and should be analyzed productively through a Freudian uncanny lens.

The narrative follows a curious young boy who discovers a mild-mannered, poetry-enthusiast dragon inhabiting a cave in the chalk hills of the English Downs near his family's home; fearing the creature's presence, the villagers summon the knight St. George to slay it according to legend , but the boy intervenes by befriending the reluctant beast and arranging a staged confrontation that resolves the conflict peacefully. [1] [2] Grahame (1859\u20131932), a former banker at the Bank of England , drew from his own childhood experiences in rural England to craft semi-autobiographical tales of imaginative youth, with Dream Days serving as a sequel to his 1895 collection The Golden Age , both featuring the same family of five siblings navigating the wonders and constraints of Victorian childhood. [1] In \"The Reluctant Dragon,\" the dragon emerges as a sensitive, intellectual figure who prefers composing verses to engaging in violence , subverting the traditional monstrous archetype from medieval legends such as the tale of St. George. [2] This portrayal humanizes the mythical creature, emphasizing themes of friendship , empathy , and non- violence , which resonated in late Victorian literature as a gentle critique of rigid social expectations and heroic conventions. [3] The story's enduring appeal lies in its whimsical humor and moral depth, influencing subsequent children's fantasy by reimagining dragons as relatable companions rathe\n\n3. [PDF] Notes Towards Gritty Fantasy Medievalism, Temporality, and ...\n   URL: http://journal.finfar.org/articles/2565.pdf\n   Site: journal.finfar.org\n   Summary: Abstract: This article discusses gritty fantasy, a fantasy subgenre, which was established in the early 2000s and has since gained a lot of traction.\n   Content: Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research journal.finfar.org Notes Towards Gritty Fantasy Medievalism, Temporality, and Worldbuilding Anna Bark Persson Abstract: This article discusses gritty fantasy, a fantasy subgenre, which was established in the early 2000s and has since gained a lot of traction. In previous research, gritty fantasy has often been understood as a deconstructive form of fantasy that draws on the barbaric Middle Ages and subverts fantasy tropes as a reaction against earlier forms of popular fantasy. I examine, rather, the genre\u2019s relation to the medieval and its depictions of power. Drawing on queer temporality and theories on fantasy literature and worldbuilding (Mendlsohn; Roine), I approach gritty fantasy first and foremost as a form of fantasy literature, placing it within the context of speculative fiction and asking what it does as a fantastic literature. Keywords: gritty fantasy, medievalism, queer temporality, speculative fiction Gritty fantasy, also known as grimdark, emerged as a major turn in popular epic fantasy in the early 2000s. Taking inspiration from works like Glen Cook\u2019s The Black Company (1984) and George R.R. Martin\u2019s A Song of Ice and Fire (1996\u2013), gritty fantasy exploded as a new wave of epic fantasy fiction with authors like Joe Abercrombie, R. Scott Bakker, and Richard Morgan. In short, gritty fantasy reacts against earlier forms of mass market, post-Tolkienian fantasy and deconstructs conventional fantasy tropes, such as good vs. evil morality and nostalgic medievalism, often through emphasizing the brutality of the pseudo-medieval fantasy world and the toll it takes on the people living in such \u201chistorical\u201d circumstances. Among fans, discussions on what gritty fantasy is, what it means, and its relation to genres of speculative fiction has abounded, but it has received less critical, academic attention.

Emily Midkiff \u201cDragons are Tricksy\u201d: The Uncanny Dragons of Children\u2019s Literature Abstract : As early as the sixties, scholars of children\u2019s literature have noted a trend to soften and satirize the dragon for children. This disconnect with traditional dragons has been bemoaned as ruining the mythic and archetypal power of dragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children\u2019s literature than readily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore, from which many children\u2019s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories. Modern tamed and human-like children\u2019s literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not always life-threatening characters. In specific, two traits borrowed from the original lore inspire uncanny doubling with their human counterparts: the dragons\u2019 intensely possessive gaze and their clever, manipulative speech.

Looking at the way these works are influenced by the 1940s pulp science fiction context and Astounding Science Fiction magazine editor John W. Campbell Jr., this article examines their shared sense of continuous urgency or impending crisis. This leads to authoritarian solutions and a recurrent focus on \u201cGreat Man\u201d characters who manipulate the society toward a better future with their enlightened awareness of the workings of history. As this article argues, while the stories justify these manipulations by a sense of urgency, they also create tensions where the manipulations become only temporary solutions and lead to predetermined futures for all but the power elite .

Looking at the way these works are influenced by the 1940s pulp science fiction context and Astounding Science Fiction magazine editor John W. Campbell Jr., this article examines their shared sense of continuous urgency or impending crisis. This leads to authoritarian solutions and a recurrent focus on \u201cGreat Man\u201d characters who manipulate the society toward a better future with their enlightened awareness of the workings of history. As this article argues, while the stories justify these manipulations by a sense of urgency, they also create tensions where the manipulations become only temporary solutions and lead to predetermined futures for all but the power elite .

Ruddick, Nicholas ...\n   Content: Fafnir \u2013 Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research journal.finfar.org Book-Review: Science Fiction Adapted to Film Don Riggs Ruddick, Nicholas. Science Fiction Adapted to Film. Gylphi, 2016. ISBN 978-1780240510. It seems that many more people know science fiction through films than through the literary works on which the films are based, which paradoxically contradicts the common axiom concerning cinematic adaptation of text that \u201cthe book is always better than the movie\u201d. Nicholas Ruddick, in his study of a wide range of such adaptations, contributes a useful distinction between science fiction and other fantastic modes of narrative, then uses this distinction to winnow out what would otherwise be a plethora \u2013 that is, an excess \u2013 of both literary texts and cinematic \u201ctexts\u201d derived from them: for Ruddick, science fiction starts with H. G. Wells as the first fabulist to take into account Darwin\u2019s Theory of Evolution as a principle of his speculative fiction. Although this may ruffle the feathers of those who, following Brian Aldiss, regard Mary Shelley as the mother of science fiction and Robert Louis Stevenson as her successor, or even Jules Verne through his meticulously designed futuristic hardware in 20,000 Leagues under the Sea and other adventures, Ruddick makes up for this dismissal of such authors and works from the SF canon by discussing some of the many films that have been inspired by these works of \u201cproto-science fiction\u201d, evidently because of their significance for the genre over the years. Ruddick eschews the term \u201cadaptation\u201d in favor of \u201cremediation\u201d since most of the worthwhile films derived from literary SF texts are what he terms a \u201ctertiary translation\u201d, or translation from one medium (text) to the very differently constituted medium of film \u2013 a \u201cmultitrack audio-visual medium\u201d (16). In his first, and shortest, section, Ruddick discusses the expressed attitudes of SF writers towards film makers and vice-versa, generally arising from\n\n3.

The narrative follows a curious young boy who discovers a mild-mannered, poetry-enthusiast dragon inhabiting a cave in the chalk hills of the English Downs near his family's home; fearing the creature's presence, the villagers summon the knight St. George to slay it according to legend , but the boy intervenes by befriending the reluctant beast and arranging a staged confrontation that resolves the conflict peacefully. [1] [2] Grahame (1859\u20131932), a former banker at the Bank of England , drew from his own childhood experiences in rural England to craft semi-autobiographical tales of imaginative youth, with Dream Days serving as a sequel to his 1895 collection The Golden Age , both featuring the same family of five siblings navigating the wonders and constraints of Victorian childhood. [1] In \"The Reluctant Dragon,\" the dragon emerges as a sensitive, intellectual figure who prefers composing verses to engaging in violence , subverting the traditional monstrous archetype from medieval legends such as the tale of St. George. [2] This portrayal humanizes the mythical creature, emphasizing themes of friendship , empathy , and non- violence , which resonated in late Victorian literature as a gentle critique of rigid social expectations and heroic conventions. [3] The story's enduring appeal lies in its whimsical humor and moral depth, influencing subsequent children's fantasy by reimagining dragons as relatable companions rathe\n",

The narrative follows a curious young boy who discovers a mild-mannered, poetry-enthusiast dragon inhabiting a cave in the chalk hills of the English Downs near his family's home; fearing the creature's presence, the villagers summon the knight St. George to slay it according to legend , but the boy intervenes by befriending the reluctant beast and arranging a staged confrontation that resolves the conflict peacefully. [1] [2] Grahame (1859\u20131932), a former banker at the Bank of England , drew from his own childhood experiences in rural England to craft semi-autobiographical tales of imaginative youth, with Dream Days serving as a sequel to his 1895 collection The Golden Age , both featuring the same family of five siblings navigating the wonders and constraints of Victorian childhood. [1] In \"The Reluctant Dragon,\" the dragon emerges as a sensitive, intellectual figure who prefers composing verses to engaging in violence , subverting the traditional monstrous archetype from medieval legends such as the tale of St. George. [2] This portrayal humanizes the mythical creature, emphasizing themes of friendship , empathy , and non- violence , which resonated in late Victorian literature as a gentle critique of rigid social expectations and heroic conventions. [3] The story's enduring appeal lies in its whimsical humor and moral depth, influencing subsequent children's fantasy by reimagining dragons as relatable companions rathe\n\n3.

In previous research, gritty fantasy has often been understood as a deconstructive form of fantasy that draws on the barbaric Middle Ages and subverts fantasy tropes as a reaction against earlier forms of popular fantasy. I examine, rather, the genre\u2019s relation to the medieval and its depictions of power. Drawing on queer temporality and theories on fantasy literature and worldbuilding (Mendlsohn; Roine), I approach gritty fantasy first and foremost as a form of fantasy literature, placing it within the context of speculative fiction and asking what it does as a fantastic literature. Keywords: gritty fantasy, medievalism, queer temporality, speculative fiction Gritty fantasy, also known as grimdark, emerged as a major turn in popular epic fantasy in the early 2000s. Taking inspiration from works like Glen Cook\u2019s The Black Company (1984) and George R.R. Martin\u2019s A Song of Ice and Fire (1996\u2013), gritty fantasy exploded as a new wave of epic fantasy fiction with authors like Joe Abercrombie, R. Scott Bakker, and Richard Morgan. In short, gritty fantasy reacts against earlier forms of mass market, post-Tolkienian fantasy and deconstructs conventional fantasy tropes, such as good vs. evil morality and nostalgic medievalism, often through emphasizing the brutality of the pseudo-medieval fantasy world and the toll it takes on the people living in such \u201chistorical\u201d circumstances. Among fans, discussions on what gritty fantasy is, what it means, and its relation to genres of speculative fiction has abounded, but it has received less critical, academic attention.

This disconnect with traditional dragons has been bemoaned as ruining the mythic and archetypal power of dragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children\u2019s literature than readily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore, from which many children\u2019s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories. Modern tamed and human-like children\u2019s literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not always life-threatening characters. In specific, two traits borrowed from the original lore inspire uncanny doubling with their human counterparts: the dragons\u2019 intensely possessive gaze and their clever, manipulative speech. This article analyzes these Freudian inheritances to argue that children\u2019s literature dragons have not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for uncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many modern children\u2019s literature dragons. This potential reveals that dragons are still strong characters and can and should be analyzed productively through a Freudian uncanny lens.

There were great, grim, sky dragons that nested on the cliff tops like gigantic scary birds. Little, brown, scuttly dragons that hunted down the mice and rats in well-organized packs. Preposterously huge Sea Dragons that were twenty times as big as the Big Blue Whale and who killed for the fun of it. You will have to take my word for it, for the dragons are disappearing so fast they may soon become extinct. Nobody knows what is happening. They are crawling back into the sea from whence they came, leaving not a bone, not a fang, in the earth for the men of the future to remember them by. So, in order that these amazing creatures should not be forgotten, I will tell this true story from my childhood. I was not the sort of boy who could train a dragon with a mere lifting of an eyebrow.

Good Dragons are Rare. An Inquiry into Literary Dragons East and West. (ALPH 5). Frankfurt a.M.: Peter Lang, 27-59.\nSummary: Prof. Tolkien noted: \u2018There are in any case many heroes but very few good dragons.\u2019 (Monsters 17) Modern readers may wonder what he meant by \u2018good dragons\u2019 \u2013 certainly not virtuous or \u2018morally good\u2019 dragons, which are, basically, a modern invention. As Tolkien himself points out, a \u2018good dragon\u2019 is a beast that displays the typical characteristics of draco without becoming a mere (allegorical) representa\u00active of draconitas (i.e. the vice of avarice). Yet \u2018death by allegory\u2019 is not the only danger literary dragons have to face. My paper looks at the symbolic and narrative functions of dragons in Germanic literature throughout the ages. As will be shown, most dragons before (but also after) Tolkien do not live up to their full literary potential as protagonist, but remain either allegorical figures of evil, devices for testing the hero\u2019s\n",

Although the films are hampered by Disney's own capitalist framework, extratextual discussion and activities can push young viewers past these limitations. This article demonstrates how to use Frozen 2 as a springboard for effective ecopedagogy in elementary-school settings.
