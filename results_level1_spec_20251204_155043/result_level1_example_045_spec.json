It blew out a huge bi-lobed bubble that blasted through the interstellar medium in two directions. Whatever it was, it released huge amounts of energy from the central supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A* for short). These bubbles contain weird, spindly one-dimensional vertical filaments that emit radio signals of their own. In 1984, astronomer Farhad Yusef-Zadeh at Northwestern University and his collaborators were the first to observe these wispy trails . Now, they know of more than a thousand of them. They give off radio waves in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Wait, There's More! Recently, the team found a smaller population of filaments near Sgr A*. However, these aren't vertical. Instead, they lie along the galactic plane and radiate away like spokes on a wheel. \"It was a surprise to suddenly find a new population of structures that seem to be pointing in the direction of the black hole,\" Yusef-Zadeh said. \"We have always been thinking about vertical filaments and their origin. I'm used to them being vertical. I never considered there might be others along the plane.\" He and the team were stunned when they saw these radially stretched structures. \"We had to do a lot of work to establish that we weren't fooling ourselves,\" he said. \"And we found that these filaments are not random but appear to be tied to the outflow of our black hole.

(Image courtesy Gary Graves) Each year from summer into fall, ornamental crape myrtle trees in the southern and central U.S. lay out a visual feast of vibrant flowers in purple, lavender, pink, red and white. But it is during the cold days of winter that the true feast begins. Goldfinches, dark-eyed juncos, house finches, cardinals, and house and white-throated sparrows visit the trees continually from early December through late February to devour the abundant seed crop that crape myrtles provide. It\u2019s a recent adaptation that represents a dramatic shift in the diet of a significant number of native U.S. bird species to a non-native plant. Gary Graves, an ornithologist at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of Natural History , recently published a short paper on this subject in the scientific journal Southeastern Naturalist . Q: Why is this shift to a new food significant? Graves: Crape myrtles (Lagerstroemia) are from eastern Asia: China and Korea. There are no species of plants in the crape myrtle genus native to North America, but introduced Lagerstroemia have been planted in incredibly large numbers in the southeastern United States. People love their showy blossoms, attractive bark, cold- and drought-hardiness, and their ability to grow in a wide range of soil types.

Received 2022 August 22; in original form 2022 June 27 A B S T R A C T Recent MeerKAT radio continuum observations of the Galactic Centre at 20 cm show a large population of non-thermal radio filaments (NRFs) in the inner few hundred pc of the Galaxy. We have selected a sample of 57 radio sources, mainly compact objects, in the MeerKAT mosaic image that appear to be associated with NRFs. The selected sources are about four times the number of radio point sources associated with filaments than would be expected by random chance. Furthermore, an apparent correlation between bright IR stars and NRFs is inferred from their similar latitude distributions, suggesting that they both co-exist within the same region. To examine if compact radio sources are related to compact IR sources, we have used archiv a l 2MASS, and Spitzer data to make spectral energy distribution of individual stellar sources coincident or close to radio sources. We provide a catalogue of radio and IR sources for future detailed observations to investigate a potential three-way physical association between NRFs, compact radio and\n\n3.

It blew out a huge bi-lobed bubble that blasted through the interstellar medium in two directions. Whatever it was, it released huge amounts of energy from the central supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A* for short). These bubbles contain weird, spindly one-dimensional vertical filaments that emit radio signals of their own. In 1984, astronomer Farhad Yusef-Zadeh at Northwestern University and his collaborators were the first to observe these wispy trails . Now, they know of more than a thousand of them. They give off radio waves in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Wait, There's More! Recently, the team found a smaller population of filaments near Sgr A*. However, these aren't vertical. Instead, they lie along the galactic plane and radiate away like spokes on a wheel. \"It was a surprise to suddenly find a new population of structures that seem to be pointing in the direction of the black hole,\" Yusef-Zadeh said. \"We have always been thinking about vertical filaments and their origin. I'm used to them being vertical. I never considered there might be others along the plane.\" He and the team were stunned when they saw these radially stretched structures. \"We had to do a lot of work to establish that we weren't fooling ourselves,\" he said. \"And we found that these filaments are not random but appear to be tied to the outflow of our black hole. By studying them, we could learn more about the black hole's spin and accretion disk orientation. It is satisfying when one finds order in a middle of a chaotic field of the nucleus of our galaxy.\" Yusef-Zadeh pointed ou\n\n2.

Now SETI Researchers can be Sure By Brian Koberlein - July 19, 2023 02:45 PM UTC | Astrobiology When SETI researchers discover an intriguing radio signal, their first instinct is to ask, \"Is the signal coming from Earth?\" So many alien messages turned out to be Earth signals reflecting off objects in space, like satellites. Scientists have developed a new technique to vet these signals and confirm whether they came from outer space, even with a single message. When a signal passes through the interstellar medium, it should be affected by free electrons from cold plasma, and it's possible to separate the genuine interstellar message from one that emanated close to Earth.

They give off radio waves in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Wait, There's More! Recently, the team found a smaller population of filaments near Sgr A*. However, these aren't vertical. Instead, they lie along the galactic plane and radiate away like spokes on a wheel. \"It was a surprise to suddenly find a new population of structures that seem to be pointing in the direction of the black hole,\" Yusef-Zadeh said. \"We have always been thinking about vertical filaments and their origin. I'm used to them being vertical. I never considered there might be others along the plane.\" He and the team were stunned when they saw these radially stretched structures. \"We had to do a lot of work to establish that we weren't fooling ourselves,\" he said. \"And we found that these filaments are not random but appear to be tied to the outflow of our black hole. By studying them, we could learn more about the black hole's spin and accretion disk orientation. It is satisfying when one finds order in a middle of a chaotic field of the nucleus of our galaxy.\" Yusef-Zadeh pointed ou\n\n2.

Now SETI Researchers can be Sure By Brian Koberlein - July 19, 2023 02:45 PM UTC | Astrobiology When SETI researchers discover an intriguing radio signal, their first instinct is to ask, \"Is the signal coming from Earth?\" So many alien messages turned out to be Earth signals reflecting off objects in space, like satellites. Scientists have developed a new technique to vet these signals and confirm whether they came from outer space, even with a single message. When a signal passes through the interstellar medium, it should be affected by free electrons from cold plasma, and it's possible to separate the genuine interstellar message from one that emanated close to Earth.

(Image courtesy Gary Graves) Each year from summer into fall, ornamental crape myrtle trees in the southern and central U.S. lay out a visual feast of vibrant flowers in purple, lavender, pink, red and white. But it is during the cold days of winter that the true feast begins. Goldfinches, dark-eyed juncos, house finches, cardinals, and house and white-throated sparrows visit the trees continually from early December through late February to devour the abundant seed crop that crape myrtles provide. It\u2019s a recent adaptation that represents a dramatic shift in the diet of a significant number of native U.S. bird species to a non-native plant. Gary Graves, an ornithologist at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of Natural History , recently published a short paper on this subject in the scientific journal Southeastern Naturalist . Q: Why is this shift to a new food significant? Graves: Crape myrtles (Lagerstroemia) are from eastern Asia: China and Korea. There are no species of plants in the crape myrtle genus native to North America, but introduced Lagerstroemia have been planted in incredibly large numbers in the southeastern United States. People love their showy blossoms, attractive bark, cold- and drought-hardiness, and their ability to grow in a wide range of soil types.

Received 2022 August 22; in original form 2022 June 27 A B S T R A C T Recent MeerKAT radio continuum observations of the Galactic Centre at 20 cm show a large population of non-thermal radio filaments (NRFs) in the inner few hundred pc of the Galaxy. We have selected a sample of 57 radio sources, mainly compact objects, in the MeerKAT mosaic image that appear to be associated with NRFs. The selected sources are about four times the number of radio point sources associated with filaments than would be expected by random chance. Furthermore, an apparent correlation between bright IR stars and NRFs is inferred from their similar latitude distributions, suggesting that they both co-exist within the same region. To examine if compact radio sources are related to compact IR sources, we have used archiv a l 2MASS, and Spitzer data to make spectral energy distribution of individual stellar sources coincident or close to radio sources. We provide a catalogue of radio and IR sources for future detailed observations to investigate a potential three-way physical association between NRFs, compact radio and\n\n3.
