World Building Edited by Marta Boni World Building Transmedia, Fans, IndustriesWorld BuildingTransmedia: Participatory Culture and Media Convergence The book series Transmedia: Participatory Culture and Media Convergence provides a platform for cutting-edge research in the field of media studies, with a strong focus on the impact of digitization, globalization, and fan culture. The series is dedicated to publishing the highest-quality monographs (and exceptional edited collections) on the developing social, cultural, and economic practices surrounding media convergence and audience participation. The term \u2018media convergence\u2019 relates to the complex ways in which the production, distribution, and consumption of contemporary media are affected by digitization, while \u2018participatory culture\u2019 refers to the changing relationship between media producers and their audiences. Interdisciplinary by its very definition, the series will provide a publishing platform for international scholars doing new and critical research in relevant fields. While the main focus will be on contemporary media culture, the series is also open to research that focuses on the historical forebears of digital convergence culture, including histories of fandom, cross- and transmedia franchises, reception studies and audience ethnographies, and critical approaches to the culture industry and commodity culture.

On the one hand, the transgression of narrative levels or fictional worlds (as well as their \u201cconfusion\u201d) may compromise the \u201csuspension of disbelief\u201d and rupture the fictional pact; on the other hand, when the \u201creality system\u201d depicted within a narrative collapses, characters, as well as readers or viewers, are forced to question the distinction between fiction and reality and to interrogate the \u201cstatus\u201d of the worlds they inhabit, with a profound sense of \u201contological\u201d vertigo.\nThe main aim of my paper is to discuss how, in the contemporary context of convergence, transmedia storytelling and participatory culture, metalepsis produces a third, fundamental \u201contological\u201d effect. More precisely, metalepsis may strengthen the illusionistic effect and creat\n\n3. 165 Traces\n   URL: https://explorer.invariantlabs.ai/u/feixieliz/gaia_magentic-one/t/149\n   Site: explorer.invariantlabs.ai\n   Summary: In Valentina Re's contribution to the 2017 book \u201cWorld Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\u201d, what horror movie does the author cite as having popularized ...\n   Content: Invariant\n"

On the one hand, the transgression of narrative levels or fictional worlds (as well as their \u201cconfusion\u201d) may compromise the \u201csuspension of disbelief\u201d and rupture the fictional pact; on the other hand, when the \u201creality system\u201d depicted within a narrative collapses, characters, as well as readers or viewers, are forced to question the distinction between fiction and reality and to interrogate the \u201cstatus\u201d of the worlds they inhabit, with a profound sense of \u201contological\u201d vertigo.\nThe main aim of my paper is to discuss how, in the contemporary context of convergence, transmedia storytelling and participatory culture, metalepsis produces a third, fundamental \u201contological\u201d effect.

World Building Edited by Marta Boni World Building Transmedia, Fans, IndustriesWorld BuildingTransmedia: Participatory Culture and Media Convergence The book series Transmedia: Participatory Culture and Media Convergence provides a platform for cutting-edge research in the field of media studies, with a strong focus on the impact of digitization, globalization, and fan culture. The series is dedicated to publishing the highest-quality monographs (and exceptional edited collections) on the developing social, cultural, and economic practices surrounding media convergence and audience participation. The term \u2018media convergence\u2019 relates to the complex ways in which the production, distribution, and consumption of contemporary media are affected by digitization, while \u2018participatory culture\u2019 refers to the changing relationship between media producers and their audiences. Interdisciplinary by its very definition, the series will provide a publishing platform for international scholars doing new and critical research in relevant fields. While the main focus will be on contemporary media culture, the series is also open to research that focuses on the historical forebears of digital convergence culture, including histories of fandom, cross- and transmedia franchises, reception studies and audience ethnographies, and critical approaches to the culture industry and commodity culture.

On the one hand, the transgression of narrative levels or fictional worlds (as well as their \u201cconfusion\u201d) may compromise the \u201csuspension of disbelief\u201d and rupture the fictional pact; on the other hand, when the \u201creality system\u201d depicted within a narrative collapses, characters, as well as readers or viewers, are forced to question the distinction between fiction and reality and to interrogate the \u201cstatus\u201d of the worlds they inhabit, with a profound sense of \u201contological\u201d vertigo.\nThe main aim of my paper is to discuss how, in the contemporary context of convergence, transmedia storytelling and participatory culture, metalepsis produces a third, fundamental \u201contological\u201d effect. More precisely, metalepsis may strengthen the illusionistic effect and creat\n\n3. 165 Traces\n   URL: https://explorer.invariantlabs.ai/u/feixieliz/gaia_magentic-one/t/149\n   Site: explorer.invariantlabs.ai\n   Summary: In Valentina Re's contribution to the 2017 book \u201cWorld Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\u201d, what horror movie does the author cite as having popularized ...\n   Content: Invariant\n",
