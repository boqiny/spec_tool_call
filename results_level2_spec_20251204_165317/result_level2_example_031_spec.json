Clarifying Apple Stock Question #12 by rccogar - opened Feb 26, 2024 Discussion rccogar Feb 26, 2024 \u2022 edited Feb 27, 2024 Hi - Just wanted to ask a clarifying question (keeping it a bit vague to avoid any risk of further contaminating others' validation results). Task ID: 08cae58d-4084-4616-b6dd-dd6534e4825b Question: \"According to Google Finance, when was the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split)?\" Annotator Steps: ''' typed in 'Google finance apple' on browser clicked first link clicked 'max' to display entire history of apple stock hovered mouse around the area that line crosses over $50 noted the date''' This was confusing - \"why is my agent getting such a different result?\" The reason is that, like most finance websites, Google Finance adjusts for stock splits by default. So the provided response is the first year Apple's stock went above $50 ( adjusting for stock splits). The date Apple's stock first crossed $50 (without adjusting for stock splits) is > 10 years earlier. So I think the question should be updated to remove the word \"without\".

But this is a common problem for fact-seeking benchmarks where annotators may not be true professionals of the field related to their questions.

Clarifying Apple Stock Question #12 by rccogar - opened Feb 26, 2024 Discussion rccogar Feb 26, 2024 \u2022 edited Feb 27, 2024 Hi - Just wanted to ask a clarifying question (keeping it a bit vague to avoid any risk of further contaminating others' validation results). Task ID: 08cae58d-4084-4616-b6dd-dd6534e4825b Question: \"According to Google Finance, when was the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split)?\" Annotator Steps: ''' typed in 'Google finance apple' on browser clicked first link clicked 'max' to display entire history of apple stock hovered mouse around the area that line crosses over $50 noted the date''' This was confusing - \"why is my agent getting such a different result?\" The reason is that, like most finance websites, Google Finance adjusts for stock splits by default. So the provided response is the first year Apple's stock went above $50 ( adjusting for stock splits). The date Apple's stock first crossed $50 (without adjusting for stock splits) is > 10 years earlier. So I think the question should be updated to remove the word \"without\". Happy to elaborate further if helpful. Thanks, C clefourrier GAIA org Apr 5, 2024 Tagging @ gregmialz on this one :) YuntaoChen Apr 16 \u2022 edited Apr 16 The question is simply wrong. The original annotator wanted to state \"backward adjusted price\" > $50, but them mistakenly described it like \"unadjusted price\" > $50, which was achieved in the second year the stock hit the market. But this is a common problem for fact-seeking benchmarks where annotators may not be true professionals of the field related to their questions.
