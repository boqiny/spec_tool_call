Data comes from NCD Risk Factor Collaboration , compiled by Business Insider . Note that rankings are based on average person height (men and women combined). For context, the global average height of a human is 5' 4\". Why are these countries shorter than average? Here\u2019s a high level analysis of why certain countries are shorter than others: Genetics: Many of the shortest countries are found in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa. These populations may be predisposed to smaller body frames. Nutrition: Nutrition during early childhood can have a significant impact on growth, meaning countries that struggle with food insecurity may see shorter heights. Socioeconomic factors: Poverty can affect living conditions and access to food & healthcare. For instance, many of the world\u2019s shortest countries are lower-income nations.

Here\u2019s a high level analysis of why certain countries are shorter than others: Genetics: Many of the shortest countries are found in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa. These populations may be predisposed to smaller body frames. Nutrition: Nutrition during early childhood can have a significant impact on growth, meaning countries that struggle with food insecurity may see shorter heights.
