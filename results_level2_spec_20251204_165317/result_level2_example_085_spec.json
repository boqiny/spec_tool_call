Without being able to load the video or wiki track list, the most likely track visible at the two-minute mark is the first race of a Mushroom Cup Grand Prix, i.e., Mario Kart Stadium. Based on historical MK8 Deluxe 150cc time trial records circa mid-2023, the world record for Mario Kart Stadium was approximately in the low 1:31 range. My best estimate is 1:31.200.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 1:31.200"
