[Clean Slate/Epic, 1999] For any Upper West Side showbiz kid, musical comedy is mother's milk, more \"natural\" than the rude attack of rock or the polite confessional of folk. And having gone mega, Fiona was autonomous enough to want it that way. With crucial help from Jon Brion, she's got the Richard Rodgers/Kurt Weill part down, and will surely tackle the Dorothy Fields/Lorenz Hart part later. Meanwhile, confessional attacks like \"A Mistake\" and \"Get Gone\" will do. Webber & Sondheim, watch out. A- Extraordinary Machine [Clean Slate/Epic, 2005] Instead of delivering the music a sharp-tongued breakup record by an empowered young female would imply--if not folk-rock plain and simple, then emotional piano-woman pop--Apple adapts Broadway show tune to confessional mode. Although Mike Elizondo adds momentum, Jon Brion's colors still predominate, and the melodic and structural contours are all Apple's. Ira Gershwin s\n\n3.

You can only bring one artist's discography to listen to. Whose\ndiscography do you bring with you?\n -- Cody Holleman , Fort Worth [A] Kids are so cute. You apparently don't know that Greil Marcus edited a\nbook based on this silly premise called Stranded 40 years ago. We were supposed to pick albums, not\noeuvres, and although Dave Marsh concocted an imaginary compilation he\nclaimed he could jerk off to, most of us took our assignment as what\nit was: a chance to celebrate a beloved album at essay length for decent money--$750, quite good\nfor the time, not to mention this one. I cheated by picking a UK-only\ndouble-LP comprising both New York Dolls LPs. For your silly question\nI'll be more literal, however, and say the choice would be between the\nBeatles and Miles Davis and I'd probably chicken out and choose Davis\nbecause he recorded so much with so many different concepts, attitudes,\ngrooves, and sonic gestalts. Sure I prefer Monk in real life. But he\njust isn't as varied. [Q] You have reviewed ever\n"

[Clean Slate/Epic, 1999] For any Upper West Side showbiz kid, musical comedy is mother's milk, more \"natural\" than the rude attack of rock or the polite confessional of folk. And having gone mega, Fiona was autonomous enough to want it that way. With crucial help from Jon Brion, she's got the Richard Rodgers/Kurt Weill part down, and will surely tackle the Dorothy Fields/Lorenz Hart part later. Meanwhile, confessional attacks like \"A Mistake\" and \"Get Gone\" will do. Webber & Sondheim, watch out. A- Extraordinary Machine [Clean Slate/Epic, 2005] Instead of delivering the music a sharp-tongued breakup record by an empowered young female would imply--if not folk-rock plain and simple, then emotional piano-woman pop--Apple adapts Broadway show tune to confessional mode. Although Mike Elizondo adds momentum, Jon Brion's colors still predominate, and the melodic and structural contours are all Apple's. Ira Gershwin s\n\n3.

You can only bring one artist's discography to listen to. Whose\ndiscography do you bring with you?\n -- Cody Holleman , Fort Worth [A] Kids are so cute. You apparently don't know that Greil Marcus edited a\nbook based on this silly premise called Stranded 40 years ago. We were supposed to pick albums, not\noeuvres, and although Dave Marsh concocted an imaginary compilation he\nclaimed he could jerk off to, most of us took our assignment as what\nit was: a chance to celebrate a beloved album at essay length for decent money--$750, quite good\nfor the time, not to mention this one. I cheated by picking a UK-only\ndouble-LP comprising both New York Dolls LPs. For your silly question\nI'll be more literal, however, and say the choice would be between the\nBeatles and Miles Davis and I'd probably chicken out and choose Davis\nbecause he recorded so much with so many different concepts, attitudes,\ngrooves, and sonic gestalts. Sure I prefer Monk in real life. But he\njust isn't as varied. [Q] You have reviewed ever\n",
