The public opening and closing dates for each exhibition have been listed when it has been possible to determine them from available archival sources.

The list is sorted chronologically by opening date and each exhibition appears only once, even if its run extended over more than one calendar year. Please note that this is a working document.

Shows listed here include special exhibitions drawn exclusively from the Museum's own collections, shows of objects loaned by other institutions or collectors, and combinations of both. Gallery rotations or new installations of permanent holdings are not included. This list includes exhibitions at the main Museum building, The Cloisters, and The Breuer, and does not record information on Met-sponsored shows held at other national or international venues. The public opening and closing dates for each exhibition have been listed when it has been possible to determine them from available archival sources. These dates may not always correspond with the dates printed in catalogues due to delayed openings, extended runs of shows, cancellations or other changes after catalogues were printed. The list is sorted chronologically by opening date and each exhibition appears only once, even if its run extended over more than one calendar year. Please note that this is a working document. For complete accuracy, information should be verified against primary source documents in the Museum Archives or Museum publications in the Watson Library. We welcome suggestions, corrections or information regarding any Museum exhibitions that may not appear here. Please direct your comments to archives@metmuseum.org.

Shows listed here include special exhibitions drawn exclusively from the Museum's own collections, shows of objects loaned by other institutions or collectors, and combinations of both. Gallery rotations or new installations of permanent holdings are not included. This list includes exhibitions at the main Museum building, The Cloisters, and The Breuer, and does not record information on Met-sponsored shows held at other national or international venues. The public opening and closing dates for each exhibition have been listed when it has been possible to determine them from available archival sources. These dates may not always correspond with the dates printed in catalogues due to delayed openings, extended runs of shows, cancellations or other changes after catalogues were printed. The list is sorted chronologically by opening date and each exhibition appears only once, even if its run extended over more than one calendar year. Please note that this is a working document. For complete accuracy, information should be verified against primary source documents in the Museum Archives or Museum publications in the Watson Library. We welcome suggestions, corrections or information regarding any Museum exhibitions that may not appear here. Please direct your comments to archives@metmuseum.org.
