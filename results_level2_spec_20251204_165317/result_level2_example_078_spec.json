In this paper, we study two variants of this kind, namely, the Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient Langevin Dynamics and the Stochastic Recursive Gradient Langevin Dynamics. We prove their convergence to the objective distribution in terms of KL-divergence under the sole assumptions of smoothness and Log-Sobolev inequality which are weaker conditions than those used in prior works for these algorithms.

We also show some essential applications of our result to non-convex optimization.

Abstract : Inverse problems are paramount in Science and Engineering. In this paper, we consider the setup of Statistical Inverse Problem (SIP) and demonstrate how Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithms can be used to solve linear SIP. We provide consistency and finite sample bounds for the excess risk. We also propose a modification for the SGD algorithm where we leverage machine learning methods to smooth the stochastic gradients and improve empirical performance. We exemplify the algorithm in a setting of great interest nowadays: the Functional Linear Regression model. In this case we consider a synthetic data example and a classification problem for predicting the main activity of bitcoin addresses based on their balances.

I thought to create a discussion thread for us to countdown and discuss any celebration/issue/complain/feedback or anything else. There is so much noise in the reviews every year. Some good work that the authors are proud of might get rejected because of the noisy system, given that NeurIPS is growing so large these years. We should keep in mind that the work is still valuable no matter what the final result is. ---------------- PS: More than 150 people are looking at this thread at 1:30pm PDT (on September 14).

Especially, its variance reduced versions have nowadays gained particular attention. In this paper, we study two variants of this kind, namely, the Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient Langevin Dynamics and the Stochastic Recursive Gradient Langevin Dynamics.

With a growing need for sparse deep learning, model compression tech- niques, especially pruning, have gained significant attention. However, conven- tionalpruningtechniquescaninadvertentlyexacerbatealgorithmicbias,resulting in unequal predictions. To address this, we define a fair pruning task where a sparsemodelisderivedsubjecttofairnessrequirements.Inparticular,wepropose a framework to jointly optimize the pruning mask and weight update processes withfairnessconstraints. Thisframeworkisengineeredtocompressmodelsthat maintainperformancewhileensuringfairnessinasingleexecution. Tothisend, we formulate the fair pruning problem as a novel constrained bi-level optimiza- tion task and derive efficient and effective solving strategies. We design exper- iments spanning various datasets and settings to validate our proposed method.

Abstract : Inverse problems are paramount in Science and Engineering. In this paper, we consider the setup of Statistical Inverse Problem (SIP) and demonstrate how Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithms can be used to solve linear SIP. We provide consistency and finite sample bounds for the excess risk. We also propose a modification for the SGD algorithm where we leverage machine learning methods to smooth the stochastic gradients and improve empirical performance. We exemplify the algorithm in a setting of great interest nowadays: the Functional Linear Regression model. In this case we consider a synthetic data example and a classification problem for predicting the main activity of bitcoin addresses based on their balances.

Some good work that the authors are proud of might get rejected because of the noisy system, given that NeurIPS is growing so large these years. We should keep in mind that the work is still valuable no matter what the final result is. ---------------- PS: More than 150 people are looking at this thread at 1:30pm PDT (on September 14).

Especially, its variance reduced versions have nowadays gained particular attention. In this paper, we study two variants of this kind, namely, the Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient Langevin Dynamics and the Stochastic Recursive Gradient Langevin Dynamics. We prove their convergence to the objective distribution in terms of KL-divergence under the sole assumptions of smoothness and Log-Sobolev inequality which are weaker conditions than those used in prior works for these algorithms. With the batch size and the inner loop length set to $\\sqrt{n}$, the gradient complexity to achieve an $\\epsilon$-precision is $\\tilde{O}((n+dn^{1/2}\\epsilon^{-1})\\gamma^2 L^2\\alpha^{-2})$, which is an improvement from any previous analyses. We also show some essential applications of our result to non-convex optimization.

With a growing need for sparse deep learning, model compression tech- niques, especially pruning, have gained significant attention. However, conven- tionalpruningtechniquescaninadvertentlyexacerbatealgorithmicbias,resulting in unequal predictions. To address this, we define a fair pruning task where a sparsemodelisderivedsubjecttofairnessrequirements.Inparticular,wepropose a framework to jointly optimize the pruning mask and weight update processes withfairnessconstraints. Thisframeworkisengineeredtocompressmodelsthat maintainperformancewhileensuringfairnessinasingleexecution. Tothisend, we formulate the fair pruning problem as a novel constrained bi-level optimiza- tion task and derive efficient and effective solving strategies. We design exper- iments spanning various datasets and settings to validate our proposed method.
