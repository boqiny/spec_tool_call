Describing such devices as the mapping out of a comprehensive series of abstract models for charting the relationships between a translated and a translating text (in the case of John Trevisa) and the construction of an authorial idiolect where no autograph survives (in the case of Thomas Hoccleve), the personal narrative now regards these attempts to reach back into the authorial psyche as hubristic, even improper. In the place of such a single authorial identity, the essay concludes by showing how authoriality rather than authorship took over in the development of a scholarly career, resulting in, for example, the founding of the interdisciplinary Society for Textual Scholarship. For Speed Hill 1 I tried to find, and be loyal to, an author: I really did. But somehow the \"psychic connections\" that my fellow-panelists identified, never quite took with me. As a very neophyte editor, I was co-opted (suborned?) into the Clarendon Press edition of John Trevisa's Middle English translation of Bartholomaeus Anglicus's De Proprietatibus Rerum (On the Prop\n\n3.

The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the o\n\n2.

Describing such devices as the mapping out of a comprehensive series of abstract models for charting the relationships between a translated and a translating text (in the case of John Trevisa) and the construction of an authorial idiolect where no autograph survives (in the case of Thomas Hoccleve), the personal narrative now regards these attempts to reach back into the authorial psyche as hubristic, even improper. In the place of such a single authorial identity, the essay concludes by showing how authoriality rather than authorship took over in the development of a scholarly career, resulting in, for example, the founding of the interdisciplinary Society for Textual Scholarship. For Speed Hill 1 I tried to find, and be loyal to, an author: I really did. But somehow the \"psychic connections\" that my fellow-panelists identified, never quite took with me. As a very neophyte editor, I was co-opted (suborned?) into the Clarendon Press edition of John Trevisa's Middle English translation of Bartholomaeus Anglicus's De Proprietatibus Rerum (On the Prop\n\n3.
