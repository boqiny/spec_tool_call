The AECOM team includes members of our national transit practice who have previously served SFRTA and other commuter railroads. The AECOM team also includes R.L. Banks & Associates, Inc. (RLBA), a railroad consulting firm with national experience supporting both public and private sector. Combined, The AECOM team understands SFRTA and the economic, finances, and management of commuter rail operations. The AECOM team recognizes the severe financial pressures driving the growing concerns regarding the SFRTA operating deficit. We also recognize that with the majority of the operational activities associated with Tri-Rail services being performed by contractors, the opportunities for savings reside in the specification of services and the cost structure within the contracts. This demands a careful examination of those contracts. Our team is well-positioned to undertake such an examination. We also recognize that solutions to controlling the operating deficit may reside on the revenue side of the income statement. SFRTA fare revenue covers a relative small portion of the operating expense. This is the result of the attractiveness of Tri-Rail services and the response of the market, along with pricing. A careful assessment of many dimensions of these issues may yield practical, implementable responses. Our approach will be to focus on tactical actions with near-term impacts. We recognize that the motivation for this project is the projected operati\n\n3.

A future second Boca Raton Station, called Boca Raton II for the balance of this study, is included in the following local, regional, and state plans: \uf0b7 SFRTA\u2019s Transit Development Plan (TDP) \uf0b7 Palm Beach Metropolitan Planning Organization\u2019s (MPO\u2019s) 2040 Long Range Transportation Plan (LRTP) \u2013 Cost Feasible \uf0b7 Florida Department of Transportation\u2019s (FDOT\u2019s) State Rail Plan Investment Element \uf0b7 FDOT District Four\u2019s Strategic Intermodal System (SIS) priority list The proposed Boca Raton II Station would be located in the vicinity of Military Trail and Glades Road, near regional destinations and major employment centers as well as large residential populations. The purpose of this study is to determine the overall feasibility of opening the Boca Raton II Station. The study included: a review of possible site locations; operational costs and impacts to existing Tri-Rail services and operations; and a benefit-cost analysis to evaluate feasibility. Site Location Analysis The study included a review of the following prior and ongoing studies: \uf0b7 SFRTA Site Location Analysis \u2013 Boca Raton II Station, May 2010 \uf0b7 Boca Raton Downtown Transit Feasibility Study, August 2016 \uf0b7 Glades Road Project Development and Environment (PD&E) study, ongoing The SFRTA Site Location Analysis identified four (4) potential sites for the proposed Boca Raton II Station. Site 1 \uf0b7 Consists of two (2) parcels equaling approximately 81,000 square feet \uf0b7 Accommodates a kiss-and-ride drop-off area, bus drop-off area, walkway to the station, station amenities, and a 50-100 space surface parking lot \uf0b7 Requires additional ingress/egress point for buses and emer\n"

The AECOM team includes members of our national transit practice who have previously served SFRTA and other commuter railroads. The AECOM team also includes R.L. Banks & Associates, Inc. (RLBA), a railroad consulting firm with national experience supporting both public and private sector. Combined, The AECOM team understands SFRTA and the economic, finances, and management of commuter rail operations. The AECOM team recognizes the severe financial pressures driving the growing concerns regarding the SFRTA operating deficit. We also recognize that with the majority of the operational activities associated with Tri-Rail services being performed by contractors, the opportunities for savings reside in the specification of services and the cost structure within the contracts. This demands a careful examination of those contracts. Our team is well-positioned to undertake such an examination. We also recognize that solutions to controlling the operating deficit may reside on the revenue side of the income statement. SFRTA fare revenue covers a relative small portion of the operating expense. This is the result of the attractiveness of Tri-Rail services and the response of the market, along with pricing. A careful assessment of many dimensions of these issues may yield practical, implementable responses. Our approach will be to focus on tactical actions with near-term impacts. We recognize that the motivation for this project is the projected operati\n\n3.

A future second Boca Raton Station, called Boca Raton II for the balance of this study, is included in the following local, regional, and state plans: \uf0b7 SFRTA\u2019s Transit Development Plan (TDP) \uf0b7 Palm Beach Metropolitan Planning Organization\u2019s (MPO\u2019s) 2040 Long Range Transportation Plan (LRTP) \u2013 Cost Feasible \uf0b7 Florida Department of Transportation\u2019s (FDOT\u2019s) State Rail Plan Investment Element \uf0b7 FDOT District Four\u2019s Strategic Intermodal System (SIS) priority list The proposed Boca Raton II Station would be located in the vicinity of Military Trail and Glades Road, near regional destinations and major employment centers as well as large residential populations. The purpose of this study is to determine the overall feasibility of opening the Boca Raton II Station. The study included: a review of possible site locations; operational costs and impacts to existing Tri-Rail services and operations; and a benefit-cost analysis to evaluate feasibility. Site Location Analysis The study included a review of the following prior and ongoing studies: \uf0b7 SFRTA Site Location Analysis \u2013 Boca Raton II Station, May 2010 \uf0b7 Boca Raton Downtown Transit Feasibility Study, August 2016 \uf0b7 Glades Road Project Development and Environment (PD&E) study, ongoing The SFRTA Site Location Analysis identified four (4) potential sites for the proposed Boca Raton II Station.
