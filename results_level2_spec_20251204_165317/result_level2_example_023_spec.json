I have copied code from one file and pasted into another, however when I have pasted the code VSC has placed a blank line between every line with code. It is quite a big file so I am hoping there is a way to identify all the blank lines at once and remove them? This is how I want the code to look: <div>\n  <h1></h1>\n  <p></p>\n</div> h\n\n2.

When we started moving our product beyond a simple REPL and started adding IDE features, we had to invent standards and wrappers around every language tool for our frontend to consume. For every editor feature, say errors and warnings (linting), we had to extend our development protocol with a set of commands and data structures, and then teach our development containers how to wrap the given tool, say Pylint, and our frontend on how to consume it (say annotate the editor with errors and warnings). A similar thing has been happening with IDEs for the past few decades -- every editor had to come up with their in-house ad-hoc protocol, and every tool developer had to build adapters and wrappers for editors to consume. However, this is about to change: a couple of years ago, Microsoft's VS Code team announced \"A Common Protocol for Languages\" , a single all-encompassing protocol that provides general-purpose language tooling -- be it refactoring, code-completion, or errors and warnings -- all implemented once and then seamlessly plugged into any editor that understands this protocol \u2014 this was dubbed the \"Language Server Protocol\" (LSP) .

I'm in a state where each time I give the agent a new \"project step\", it seems like its forgetting the building blocks we have created and erases core parts of the code. Imagine an app where you can enter recipes and ingredients for these recipes. If I'm adding a feature in managing ingredients, it erases the recipe part! I have to manually copy paste back the code. Have you found a way to get around that? I'm trying prompts around not deleting other parts of the code but it doesnt understand. I'm wondering if maybe I structure the project differently so each file is more focused on a part of the code?

When we started moving our product beyond a simple REPL and started adding IDE features, we had to invent standards and wrappers around every language tool for our frontend to consume. For every editor feature, say errors and warnings (linting), we had to extend our development protocol with a set of commands and data structures, and then teach our development containers how to wrap the given tool, say Pylint, and our frontend on how to consume it (say annotate the editor with errors and warnings). A similar thing has been happening with IDEs for the past few decades -- every editor had to come up with their in-house ad-hoc protocol, and every tool developer had to build adapters and wrappers for editors to consume. However, this is about to change: a couple of years ago, Microsoft's VS Code team announced \"A Common Protocol for Languages\" , a single all-encompassing protocol that provides general-purpose language tooling -- be it refactoring, code-completion, or errors and warnings -- all implemented once and then seamlessly plugged into any editor that understands this protocol \u2014 this was dubbed the \"Language Server Protocol\" (LSP) . In addition to LSP, VS Code also open-source\n"

I have copied code from one file and pasted into another, however when I have pasted the code VSC has placed a blank line between every line with code. It is quite a big file so I am hoping there is a way to identify all the blank lines at once and remove them? This is how I want the code to look: <div>\n  <h1></h1>\n  <p></p>\n</div> h\n\n2.

Imagine an app where you can enter recipes and ingredients for these recipes. If I'm adding a feature in managing ingredients, it erases the recipe part! I have to manually copy paste back the code. Have you found a way to get around that? I'm trying prompts around not deleting other parts of the code but it doesnt understand.
