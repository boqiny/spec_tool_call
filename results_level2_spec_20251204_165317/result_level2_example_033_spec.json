As you know, this is our final report before the International Sustainability Standards Board assumes responsibility for monitoring companies\u2019 progress on climate-related disclosure as of next year. It reflects not only on progress made over the last year, but also on experiences and insights gained over the eight years since the Task Force was formed. The final TCFD recommendations published in June 2017 were designed to provide a framework for companies to disclose critical climate-related financial information to help increase consistency and comparability around the world. Six years later, the recommendations have become the foundation for national and international climate-related disclosure requirements \u2014 including as the global baseline set by the International Sustainability Standards Board\u2019s general sustainability-related and climate-related disclosure standards \u2014 and have driven far greater consistency in companies\u2019 climate-related reporting. In short, the Task Force\u2019s work has been an unequivocal success. The success of the TCFD\u2019s recommendations can be demonstrated by the 19 jurisdictions, accounting for close to 60% of global 2022 GDP, with final or proposed TCFD-aligned disclosure requirements. Additionally, the Task Force has seen over 4,800 organizations indicate their support for the TCFD\u2019s recommendations, ranging from companies and civil society to governments. However, more needs to be done. As this report describes, although companies continue to make progress in their disclosures, significant gaps in data remain. In particular, reporting the impact of climate change on companies\n"

As you know, this is our final report before the International Sustainability Standards Board assumes responsibility for monitoring companies\u2019 progress on climate-related disclosure as of next year. It reflects not only on progress made over the last year, but also on experiences and insights gained over the eight years since the Task Force was formed. The final TCFD recommendations published in June 2017 were designed to provide a framework for companies to disclose critical climate-related financial information to help increase consistency and comparability around the world. Six years later, the recommendations have become the foundation for national and international climate-related disclosure requirements \u2014 including as the global baseline set by the International Sustainability Standards Board\u2019s general sustainability-related and climate-related disclosure standards \u2014 and have driven far greater consistency in companies\u2019 climate-related reporting. In short, the Task Force\u2019s work has been an unequivocal success. The success of the TCFD\u2019s recommendations can be demonstrated by the 19 jurisdictions, accounting for close to 60% of global 2022 GDP, with final or proposed TCFD-aligned disclosure requirements. Additionally, the Task Force has seen over 4,800 organizations indicate their support for the TCFD\u2019s recommendations, ranging from companies and civil society to governments. However, more needs to be done. As this report describes, although companies continue to make progress in their disclosures, significant gaps in data remain. In particular, reporting the impact of climate change on companies\n",
