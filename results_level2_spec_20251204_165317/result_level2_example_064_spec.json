A Dark Trace Sigmund Freud on the Sense of Guilt Download PDF Viewer Web Shop Author(s) Westerink, Herman Language English Show full item record Abstract Sigmund Freud, in his search for the origins of the sense of guilt in individual life and culture, regularly speaks of \u201creading a dark trace\u201d, thus referring to the Oedipus myth as a myth on the problem of human guilt. The sense of guilt is indeed a trace that leads deep into the individual\u2019s mental life, into his childhood life, and into the prehistory of culture and religion. In this book this trace is followed and thus Freud\u2019s thought on the sense of guilt as a central issue in his work is analyzed, from the earliest studies on the moral and \u201cguilty\u201d characters of the hysterics, via the later complex differentiations in the concept of the sense of guilt, unto the analyses of civilization\u2019s discontents and Jewish sense of guilt. The sense of guilt is a key issue in Freudian psychoanalysis, not only in relation to other key concepts in psychoanalytic theory, but also in relation to debates with others, such as Carl Gustav Jung or Melanie Klein, Freud was engaged in.

Authorized translation from the Dutch language edition published by Uitgeverij Boom, Amsterdam (The Netherlands), 2005. 319 pp. $60.00 (cloth). ISBN 978-90-5867-754-9 This book offers yet another account of the chronological development of Freud\u2019s thought, differing from other such studies in the attention it devotes to his evolving conceptualization of the sense of guilt. At the conclusion of his text the author writes: \u201c\u2026 despite the centrality of the sense of guilt in Freud\u2019s thought and, in the debates of his followers, despite the importance of these discussions for current debates between psychoanalytic schools, and despite the fact that the sense of guilt is the central issue in Freud\u2019s studies on culture and religion, studies on Freud\u2019s thought on the issue are rare. My reconstruction of Freud\u2019s theories on the sense of guilt fills that lacuna\u201d (p. 302). Although the book does not claim to do more than trace \u201ca dark trace\u201d in Freud\u2019s work, it nevertheless seems odd in 2010 to read a contemporary publication that might well have been written in the 1940s. The book does go slightly beyond Freud\u2019s own work on the sense of guilt, addressing in the penultimate chapter the controversies stimulated by Melanie Klein, Karen Horney and others surrounding the pre-oedipal phase, the role of the mother and the psychology of women and the implications of their contributions for Freud\u2019s theory of guilt. But over five decades have passed since these controversies took place and many important contributions to this subject, such as Eli Sagan\u2019s (1988) Freud, Women, and Morality: The Psychology of Good and Evil, are entirely neglected here. True, the author claims only to address Sigmund Freud on the sense of guilt, but there is much more to psychoanalysis than Sigmund Freud and the topic is very worth a far more comprehensive and up-to-date treatment\u2014and a more\n"

A Dark Trace Sigmund Freud on the Sense of Guilt Download PDF Viewer Web Shop Author(s) Westerink, Herman Language English Show full item record Abstract Sigmund Freud, in his search for the origins of the sense of guilt in individual life and culture, regularly speaks of \u201creading a dark trace\u201d, thus referring to the Oedipus myth as a myth on the problem of human guilt. The sense of guilt is indeed a trace that leads deep into the individual\u2019s mental life, into his childhood life, and into the prehistory of culture and religion. In this book this trace is followed and thus Freud\u2019s thought on the sense of guilt as a central issue in his work is analyzed, from the earliest studies on the moral and \u201cguilty\u201d characters of the hysterics, via the later complex differentiations in the concept of the sense of guilt, unto the analyses of civilization\u2019s discontents and Jewish sense of guilt. The sense of guilt is a key issue in Freudian psychoanalysis, not only in relation to other key concepts in psychoanalytic theory, but also in relation to debates with others, such as Carl Gustav Jung or Melanie Klein, Freud was engaged in.

Authorized translation from the Dutch language edition published by Uitgeverij Boom, Amsterdam (The Netherlands), 2005. 319 pp. $60.00 (cloth). ISBN 978-90-5867-754-9 This book offers yet another account of the chronological development of Freud\u2019s thought, differing from other such studies in the attention it devotes to his evolving conceptualization of the sense of guilt. At the conclusion of his text the author writes: \u201c\u2026 despite the centrality of the sense of guilt in Freud\u2019s thought and, in the debates of his followers, despite the importance of these discussions for current debates between psychoanalytic schools, and despite the fact that the sense of guilt is the central issue in Freud\u2019s studies on culture and religion, studies on Freud\u2019s thought on the issue are rare. My reconstruction of Freud\u2019s theories on the sense of guilt fills that lacuna\u201d (p. 302). Although the book does not claim to do more than trace \u201ca dark trace\u201d in Freud\u2019s work, it nevertheless seems odd in 2010 to read a contemporary publication that might well have been written in the 1940s. The book does go slightly beyond Freud\u2019s own work on the sense of guilt, addressing in the penultimate chapter the controversies stimulated by Melanie Klein, Karen Horney and others surrounding the pre-oedipal phase, the role of the mother and the psychology of women and the implications of their contributions for Freud\u2019s theory of guilt. But over five decades have passed since these controversies took place and many important contributions to this subject, such as Eli Sagan\u2019s (1988) Freud, Women, and Morality: The Psychology of Good and Evil, are entirely neglected here. True, the author claims only to address Sigmund Freud on the sense of guilt, but there is much more to psychoanalysis than Sigmund Freud and the topic is very worth a far more comprehensive and up-to-date treatment\u2014and a more\n",
